(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)                         ASSISI, Italy (AP) — Pilgrims have been pouring into this medieval hilltop town to venerate not only two of the Catholic Church’smost celebrated saints, Francisand Clare, but its newest —Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint, who will be canonized on April 27. “St. Francis, St. Clare, of course, important saints who marked an epoch – but that’s far removed from today’s teens. Carlo is like the kids,” said Maria Rosario Riccio, a mother and educator who was visiting Acutis’ shrine recently with a 50-strong parish youth group from southern Italy. “He’s a near-saint of our time, who can show teens that it’s possible to love Jesus while being a regular youth.” The group lined up to enter the Santuario della Spogliazione — a somber church, also known as Santa Maria Maggiore, marking the spot where more than 800 years ago St. Francis renounced his family’s wealth. There, they prayed by the monument where Acutis’ body is on view, wearing jeans, a sweatshirt and sneakers. On that Saturday, hundreds filed past — a priest and his parishioners from the Azores islands, a nun from Colombia and her Passionist sisters, a family with two teens from near Venice. Someclutched rosaries, others took selfies or touched the protective glass in front of the seemingly sleeping young man, who died of leukemia at 15 in 2006 and is generating a devotion that astonishes even Assisi’s bishop. “I’m seeing here a volcano of grace erupting … I can’t believe my eyes,” said the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino. When he became bishop two decades ago, the church next to his residence just off the main street was “forgotten” by the throngs that visited the monumental Basilica of St. Francis.  Over the last year, more than a million pilgrims paid homage to Acutis, Sorrentino said, drawn by “his smiling way of living our faith.” The teen’s happy image, usually in a red polo shirt and carrying a backpack, is as popular in souvenir shops across town as Francis in his simple brown habit. One store owner picked up a blessed icon the first time she went to the shrine and keeps it glued to her cash register. “I was really curious about this new saint who attracts youth,” Silvia Balducci said. Both the church and his family describe Acutis as an exceptionally devout but otherwise regular Italian boy, who’s working miracles after his untimely death precisely by drawing youth to faith whenmost of his contemporaries are abandoningorganized religion. “Carlo wasn’t an alien, he was a normal person. But if it’s illuminated by the light of Christ, a life becomes extraordinary,” his mom, Antonia Salzano Acutis, told The Associated Press. “We always pray to the saints, and in the end, what did saints do? They opened the doors of their lives to Christ.” She quoted one of her son’s favorite phrases: “’Everyone is born an original, but many die photocopies.” “The saint is one who didn’t die like a photocopy, who realized that project of holiness that God established in eternity for each of us, as we all should,” she said. Not an observant Catholic herself when she had him, Acutis used to joke with her husband that their young son was “a little Buddha” because of his unselfishness, attention to others, and cheerful obedience. He developed a precocious interest in faith, such as wanting to enter every church to “say hi” to Jesus and Mary. Later, he started attending Mass,adoring the Blessed Sacramentand praying the rosary daily — while also entertaining with jokes his friends who were less interested in religion and more into going to nightclubs with their girlfriends and smoking an occasional joint. “This was a bit of a way of hiding his faith life, because Carlo knew that his friends couldn’t understand,” his mother said. “But Carlo was a witness, a silent witness through the value of friendship, through the value of generosity, helping his classmates in school, defending the teens who were bullied.” Acutis often helped the homeless and was uninterested in the trappings common for a wealthy child in Milan, one of Europe’sfashion and business capitals. He asked his parents to donate to the poor what they would have spent for a second pair of sneakers for him, and insisted he wanted to teach catechism at his parish instead of going on skiing holidays at fancy resorts like his peers. That denial of privilege is a parallel with St. Francis, to whom Acutis was so devoted that he asked to be buried in Assisi, said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent most of his religious career there and heads the pontifical committee for World Children’s Day. “And there are more similarities with St. Francis. St. Francis left the churches and went to the squares to preach. Carlo Acutis prophetically realized that today the public squares are online, on the Web,” Fortunato said. “That’s where youth are, that’s where people are, so he lives and brings the Gospel in those squares. That’s one of the reasons why he will become the patron of the Web, Internet and social media.” Particularly devout to the eucharist and wanting to share the Catholic belief that Jesus is literally present in it, Acutis created an online exhibit about miracles where the bread and wine became flesh and blood throughout the centuries. It’s been used in thousands of parishes worldwide, his mother said. For her, his being “a bridge to Jesus” — even in his terminal illness, which he faced without complaining, certain of eternal life — is a more important legacy than any miracles or supernatural signs. To become a saint, however,miracles do need to be attested. One in Acutis’ canonization process was the healing of a Costa Rican student from a bicycle accident in Italy after her mother prayed to him, Sorrentino said. Sabina Falcetta goes often to Acutis’ shrine from the nearby city of Perugia with a group of fellow mothers to pray for their children. “Carlo Acutis gives us peace,” she said. “Most importantly he gives us the certainty that God is a good father. And you can’t ask for more.” As she talked outside the sanctuary, a Confirmation group from Lake Garda in northern Italy was praying in a circle by a cutout of Acutis in his jeans and backpack standing by a larger-than-life monstrance. One of the catechists, Veronica Abraham, said she had been teaching about both St. Francis and Acutis, focusing on the teen’s charity and his custom of sitting down to chat with anyone who looked lonely, “since even a ciao is important for those who are alone.” Her son Mario Girardi, 13, said he was really struck by the fact that Acutis — when only a couple of years older than him — “spoke with everyone, didn’t let anything bother him but helped everyone.” While he’s not considering the priesthood, Girardi does go to church every Sunday and plans to “always stay in this mindset” — maybe even going to daily Mass. Would he want to become a saint, too? “Well, let’s hope. Yes, right? Never say never, who knows,” the boy said, grinning.

Wisconsin’s governor vetoes a bill that would revive old test score standards,https://apnews.com/article/test-scores-superintendent-wisconsin-bill-republicans-9b07826b723a3e06e1efec745f82ee7d,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers gives the annual State of the State address Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025, at the state Capitol in Madison, Wis. (AP Photo/Morry Gash, File) MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a Republican-authored bill Friday that would have required state education officials to score standardized student tests according to the scale they used years ago. State schools Superintendent Jill Underly, a liberal who faces conservative Brittany Kinser in Tuesday’s spring election, changed student standardized testing benchmarks and scoring thresholds for school district performance report cards last year. She has said that she made the performance changes at the request of Wisconsin teachers and how they felt their students can perform. Republicans argue the changes watered down standards in an effort to artificially inflate performance grades and made it harder to compare Wisconsin students and districts to their peers around the rest of the country. Evers has said Underly made a mistake because she didn’t cerate a public dialogue about the changes before she imposed them, but online legislative records indicate he vetoed the bill on Friday morning. The governor said in his veto message that while he’s been critical of the process, he objects to legislators trying to undermine the state superintendent’s authority and independence. Evers served as state schools superintendent before he became governor in 2019. The measure would have required education officials to apply performance levels established by the National Assessment of Educational Process when rating the Wisconsin Forward exam, a standardized English and math test.  They also would have had to use terms from the 2021-22 school year to rate student performance on two other standardized tests, the PreACT and ACT with Writing in English, Reading and Mathematics. The categories would be called “below basic,” “basic,” “proficient” or “advanced.” DPI now describes student performance levels as “advanced,” “meeting,” “approaching” and “developing.” The state Department of Public Instruction would have had to use the same scoring system for school district report cards as the agency used during the 2019-20 school year.

(AP) — For years, the mayor of a Boston suburb dreaded Wednesdays. That was the day when a local weekly would publish shocking allegations that he was on the take, sexually harassing women or under investigation by the FBI. Friends trashed Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria on Facebook over what the Everett Leader Herald printed. His father threatened to disown him — over stories the mayor knew were lies. “They labeled me as a ‘Kickback Carlo.’ Accusations that I was settling all kinds of sexual harassment lawsuits, that I put a knife to a girl’s throat and asked for sexual favors,” DeMaria said. “It was awful. It was disgusting.” Almost everything the paper wrote about DeMaria turned out to be fake, enabling him to win a $1.1 million settlement in December that finally shut down the nearly 140-year-old paper. Such defamation victories are exceedingly rare under the Supreme Court’s“actual malice”standard for public figures. That willing disregard for the truth became abundantly evident when the paper’s editor swore in court to tell the truth, and admitted to fabricating story after story in an unrelenting smear campaign. But DeMaria hardly had time to celebrate. Now preparing for his seventh mayoral campaign, he’s been accused of padding his salary with bonus payments — an issue the paper covered four years ago — and this time, the state of Massachusetts is pressing the City Council to take action. Favoring sharp suits and slicked-back hair, DeMaria was schooled in a style of politics based on personal connections with fellow residents in the working-class town of about 49,000 across the Mystic River from Boston. As mayor in 2007, he’s been praised for his leadership in improving infrastructure. Out-of-towners can now look beyond the Monsanto and Exxon Mobil facilities as they come to aglitzy casinoand soon, possibly,a professional soccer stadium.  Everett, Mass. Mayor Carlo DeMaria talks with guests while visiting a senior luncheon following a bingo game at the Connolly Center, Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, in Everett. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)  Everett voters reelected DeMaria by landslides, and his annual compensation grew to $232,700, including a car allowance and a “longevity bonus,” approaching the $250,000 salary of Mayor Michelle Wu of Boston, a city nearly 14 times larger. Then, after a brutal 2021 campaign, he held onto office by just over 200 votes. Matthew Philbin had bought the Leader Herald in 2017 and hired a Boston-area reporter Joshua Resnek, to turn it into an attack machine, court records show. DeMaria believes Philbin was angry at him after he opposed his boarding house licenses as a councilman and then rejected giving him a city insurance contract after he became mayor. Resnek invented a City Hall insider he called the “Blue Suit” and in article after article, made up conversations accusing “Kickback Carlo” of extorting the city clerk in a land deal, shaking down people for contributions and sexually assaulting women. In an emotional press conference to announce his court victory, DeMaria stood with his wife and expressed vindication. “The size and scope of this settlement — both in terms of the amount that the defendants have agreed to pay and in their agreement to shut down their newspaper — is a reflection of just how egregious their conduct was, and of the volume of their admissions of their misconduct,” DeMaria said. Neither Philbin, Resnek nor their lawyers responded to repeated requests for comment, but the paper’s final edition reported that “the settlement leaves all parties satisfied that an agreeable arrangement was reached, making the necessity of a trial a moot point.” Some residents grumbled aboutthe loss of local news coverage. “We need all kinds of voices,” said Everett homeowner Peggy Serino, a regular at council meetings. “Just because the administration didn’t agree with something doesn’t mean you shut it down.” Someone complained to the state Office of the Inspector General about the bonus payments in 2022, after the Leader Herald suggested they were illegal and quoted a mayoral challenger who called them “greedy.” DeMaria turned down his 2022 payment of $40,000, and the council limited his future payments to what other city workers get — about $1,700 a year. After a lengthy investigation, the Inspector General concluded in February that DeMaria colluded with his finance officer and budget director to retroactively get $180,000 from 2016 to 2021, hiding the payments within other line-items. The IG also concluded that DeMaria may have violated state ethics law by participating in the drafting and approval of the ordinance that padded his pay. The City Council has turned on him since the report came out. It can’t fire him, but councilors demanded repayment and launched an audit into nearly a decade’s worth of payments to him. They also requested details they could bring to the state ethics commission, which can fine an official up to $10,000 per violation and refer evidence of any crimes to prosecutors. DeMaria insists he never “engaged in concealment” and that law enforcement has not contacted him. It’s all just small-town politics, he said. “Those who have falsely accused me over the years are the ones who are guilty of the real wrongdoing,” he said. “I will continue to fight to protect my family, but also to undo the harm that has been done to the reputation of Everett and its residents by these unnecessary and unfounded attacks.” Everett, Mass. Mayor Carlo DeMaria, listens to a reporter’s question during an interview at his attorney’s office, Friday Dec. 20, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)  DeMaria didn’t attend a special meeting packed with city employees where his lawyer and his daughter came to defend him. Launching his reelection campaign weeks later, he asked supporters to withhold judgment until all the facts come out. Not everyone is willing to wait. The City Council approved a no-confidence vote and ended future longevity payments for him. “This is a sad day for our community,” City Councilor Peter Pietrantonio said. “These are serious facts against the mayor and his administration ... To me, it’s appalling.” Councilor at Large Guerline Alcy Jabouin asked the many city workers supporting DeMaria to look beyond their allegiances. “Think about your property taxes. Think about the school that isn’t getting enough money. Think about your grandmother, your grandfather that cannot afford to pay for their medication,” Jabouin said.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File) ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are less likely to see Canada and the U.S. as close allies than they were two years ago, the latest indication that President Donald Trump’stariff threatsand talk of taking overa neighboring allyare souring a critical economic and military relationship.  The U.S. shift in viewpoint comes primarily from Democrats, though Republicans are less likely to see Canada as America’s ally now too, according to a new poll fromThe Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While about 7 in 10 Democrats saw Canada and the U.S. as close allies before Trump returned to office, now that number is down to about half. For Republicans, the number dropped from 55% to 44%. Although most still see the countries’ relationship as at least “friendly,” just under half of U.S. adults now consider the U.S. to be “close allies” with its neighbor to the north. That’s down from about 6 in 10 in aPearson Institute/AP-NORC pollconducted in September 2023. “He’s turning everybody against us,” bemoaned Lynn Huster, 73, a lifelong Democrat who lives in York, Pennsylvania. Huster says she has been dismayed by Trump’s actions and how they have affected relationships with other allies, including the United Kingdom. “Canada,” she said, had been “our friends, you know, they backed us. And some of the other countries, the U.K., they don’t want any part of us anymore. And it’s sad that our country’s going to stand alone if anything happens.”  The poll comes as Trump has dramatically realigned U.S. foreign policy and America’s relations since his return to office. He hasslapped sweeping tariffs on goodsmade in Canada, Mexico and China, and this weekadded a 25% tax on imported autos. Next week, he says he will put in place“reciprocal” taxesmirroring the tariffs charged by other nations — a move he is calling “Liberation Day.” Beyond the economic threats, Trump has repeatedly antagonized and belittled historic partners, notably the one with which the U.S. shares a 5,500-mile (8,900-kilometer) border. He has threatened Canada’s sovereignty,saying it should become the country’s 51st state, and repeatedly labeled its prime minister “governor.” His moves have sparkeddeep feelings of betrayalacross Canada, where the U.S.-Canada relationship had long been seen akin to family. The U.S. national anthem has been booed at Canadian arenas and American liquor has been stripped from Canadian shelves. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whoseparty’s fortunes have been revivedby taking a hard line against Trump, said Thursday that the U.S. is “no longer a reliable partner” and that Canadians must now “look out for ourselves.” Shaya Scher, 35, a Republican who lives in New Jersey, argues that Trump’s rhetoric toward Canada is largely bluster. “I think he’s just doing it to make them freak out so they can get a deal,” Scher said. He believes a deal will eventually happen and tensions will ease. “I think at the end of the day, they’re still allies,” he said. “Under the hood we’re still allies, and if anything comes up, we’ll still be allies.” Others, however, were more despondent. “He’s sabotaging decades of goodwill by having tariffs on foreign steel and foreign cars and foreign flowers,” said Scott Cunningham, 69, a Democrat who lives in South Bend, Indiana. “Tariffs are really going to hurt relationships — trading relationships, personal relationships — after being allies for decades. You do something like that, I’m going to remember that.” About 3 in 10 Americans see Canada as “friendly but not a close ally,” while about 2 in 10 say the two countries are “not friendly but not enemies.” Very few see them as outright “enemies.” Cunningham characterized the current U.S. relationship with Canada as “not friendly but not enemies.” “We’re not friends because of tariffs and him wanting to take over the country. That’s not going well,” he said. ”It’s very strained right now.” When it comes to the rest of the world, the AP-NORC poll found about half of U.S. adults see the United Kingdom as a close U.S. ally, but only about 3 in 10 say the same about France and Germany. About 4 in 10 say the European Union is a close ally. Almost no Americans see either Russia or China as a close ally. About one-third say China is an enemy of the United States, and a similar share think this about Russia. Republicans are less likely to see Russia as a threat. Only about one-third of Republicans see Russia as an enemy of the U.S., compared to about 4 in 10 Democrats. Trent Ramsaran, 37, a freelancer who lives in Brooklyn, New York, said many European leaders of traditional U.S. allies clearly have conflicting views with Trump, particularly on immigration. “I’m starting to see the pattern there where it seems like all these quote-unquote allies are in favor of having immigrants take over the country,” he said. “His vision is really not the same as these allies. So he’s saying these allies are not on the same page.” But Ramsaran said he’s not at all worried about the U.S. someday needing allies it has alienated, given how much the country spends on defense and high-tech weapons. “If America ended up being attacked, I’m totally confident that we do not need the help of our allies to defend this country,” he said. “We’ve got Tom Cruise. He can teach people how to dogfight in ‘Top Gun.’” Colvin reported from New York. The AP-NORC poll of 1,229 adults was conducted Mar. 20-24, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File)         TheSundance Film Festivalis Boulder bound, leaving its home of four decades in Park City, Utah, for a new chapter in neighboring Colorado. Organizersannounced their decisionThursday after a yearlong search in which numerous U.S. cities vied to host the nation’s premiere independent film festival. The other finalists were Cincinnati, Ohio, and a combinedSalt Lake City and Park City bid. Festival leaders said politics did not influence their move from conservative Utah to liberal Colorado. They did however make “ethos and equity values” one of their criteria and referred to Boulder in their announcement as a “welcoming environment.” Boulder stood out to organizers as an artsy, walkable and medium-sized city close to nature. It has one of the highest concentrations of professional artists in the U.S. and is home to the University of Colorado, where the film program contributes to a vibrant art scene, Sundance leaders said. They noted the large student population and campus venues will create new opportunities to engage young people in the event. Nearby nature in the Rocky Mountain foothills offers room for visitors and artists to stretch their legs and draw inspiration from high country scenery. It’s also just over half an hour from downtown Denver and not much farther to the city’s international airport. When Sundance leaders began their search for a new home, they said the festival had outgrown the charming ski town of Park City and developed an air of exclusivity that took focus away from the films. Boulder, a city of 100,000 people, has space for a more centralized festival. But it’s not all that more affordable for attendees. The cost of living is estimated to be 31% higher than the national average, versus Park City’s 33%, according to the Economic Research Institute. Actor Jonah Hill, “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and — perhaps most significantly — Sundance founder Robert Redford all attended the University of Colorado in Boulder. The school has aheady party culturethat sometimes spills into the surrounding streets. The city is also home to a private Buddhist college. Redford, 88,gave the festival’s relocation his blessing. Just outside Denver’s suburbs, Boulder has its own identity — and decades ago a very unique, hippie vibe. Well before Colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, thousands of University of Colorado students and others would gather on campus to smoke pot every April 20. Today, Boulder retains its charm at the foot of the sandstone Flatirons, a foothill range crisscrossed by hiking trails that begin at the Colorado Chautauqua, a cultural and performing arts hub dating to the 1800s. The pedestrian-only Pearl Street Mall with its nearby theaters could provide a similar central hub to Park City’s Main Street. It’s no longer ideal for hippies, however. The university kicked the 4/20 weed fest off campus and soaring housing costs — the median home price is now $1.1 million — make living there unattainable for most. Films have been shown in Boulder since 1898, when the first kinetoscope, a device co-invented by Thomas Edison, showed moving pictures to one person at a time at the Chautauqua Auditorium. Besides Redford, Hollywood names who attended the University of Colorado include Dalton Trumbo, a screenwriter for “Spartacus” and “Roman Holiday” who was among the Hollywood Ten blacklisted for suspected communist sympathies in the late 1940s and 1950s. In the 1970s and 1980s, Boulder locations featured as backdrops in the Woody Allen film “Sleeper” and Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining.” And Boulder was the fictional setting of the TV show “Mork & Mindy.” Today, it’s home to more than a dozen smaller film festivals, including the Boulder International Film Festival and Chautauqua Silent Film Series. Sundance has called Park City home for 41 years. Past leaders of the festival said Redford chose the mountains of Utah as a space to foster independent filmmaking away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. Utah’s iconic red rock landscapes have served as a backdrop to many films, including “Thelma and Louise,” “Forrest Gump” and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” for which the festival is named. This year, thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read “Keep Sundance in Utah” in a last-ditch effort to convince its leaders to keep it local. Sundance will have one more festival in Park City in January 2026 before moving to Boulder in 2027. Over four decades, Sundance helped transform its quaint mountain hometown into a renowned winter destination.

(Arvin Temkar/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)     ATLANTA (AP) — For Georgia lawmakers to agree on a state budget, they must first agree on how much they are going to spend on anew voucher programfor private schools and home schooling. Georgia’s voucher program is different from some states, with lawmakers agreeing when they created the program last year that lawmakers would decide each year how to spend. The state Senate, which passed its version ofnext year’s budgeton Friday, wants to spend $141 million on the program. House members proposed spending only $46 million. It is a key disagreement lawmakers must resolve before Georgia’s annual legislative session ends next week At $6,500 per voucher, the Senate amount would provide enough for more than 21,000 vouchers, while the House amount would provide for only about 7,000 slots. The overall budget would spend $37.7 billion in state revenue in the year beginning July 1. Once federal and other money is combined, it would be more than $67 billion. Voucher programsare ballooning nationwide. Many supporters want all students to be eligible, regardless of school performance or family income. States that have adopteduniversal vouchers, such as Arizona, Florida, Iowa and Ohio, reported more applications than expected, causing costs to bulge. Georgia Democrats fear that happening here, although lawmakers would have to change state law to spend more than 1% of what the state spends on public schools.  “Let’s call this what it is, a transfer of public money into private hands,” said Democratic Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes of Duluth. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican, defended the program and spending, arguing that low reading achievement levels point to the need for change. “The reason we support a voucher program is because kids have to be given an ability to do something better,” Tillery said. “Their parents have to be given options to take their kids somewhere else. Why? Because we have failed them.” House members, though, have complained that the Georgia Education Savings Authority, the group created to administer the program,interpreted the lawin such a way that it made many more students eligible than many lawmakers had expected. The program is midway through its first application period, which runs until April 15. As of Thursday, 4,439 applications had been approved. There are two more application periods set for the summer and fall, but it is unclear how many total applications would be approved. Tillery said Thursday that if the scholarship program doesn’t need the entire $141 million, lawmakers can take the money back later. The Senate budget also rejected a House proposal to borrow more than $300 million next year for construction projects. Instead, the Senate plan would spend on construction only from existing state revenue for the third year in a row. “We’re funding that with cash, saving generations 10 and 20 years from now from paying for buildings we’re building now,” Tillery said. Gov. Brian Kemp sets the maximum amount that lawmakers can spend, so they can only move money around to different spending items. That means lawmakers must decrease spending on one item to increase spending on another item. So with the Senate rejecting borrowing and increasing spending on vouchers, it pinched spending the House proposed on other items, including supplemental funding toeducate students in poverty. The Senate plan also spends less than the House proposed on prisons, mental health, housing and grants to rural communities.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

She’s the co-founder of the home management app Coexist, which helps families collaborate at home. In addition to leading by example, she has these suggestions: — Pick your battles and start small. “Focus on pointing out one habit — like composting, reducing single-use plastics or taking public transit — and build up from there,” she said. — Frame sustainability around the other person’s priorities. “If they don’t care about sustainability, focus on what they do care about. Many eco-friendly choices also save money, cut down on clutter or make daily life more efficient. For example,meal planningreduces food waste and saves money.” — Make it easy. “Small shifts like keeping reusable bags in the car or setting up a simple recycling system can make sustainable choices feel automatic rather than like extra work.” — Respect the other person’s boundaries. “If someone is resistant to a particular habit, it helps to take a step back and focus on what’s working rather than forcing the issue.

"Texas AG investigating insurance company accused of spying on lawmakers, journalists, other Texans",https://apnews.com/us-news/ken-paxton-espionage-texas-mark-sanders-government-programs-650f7eb797e43fd6a7078f6fe5e31c03,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Thursday that he has launched an investigation into one of the state’s Medicaid insurance providers after allegations that the company illegally spied on Texans. The state is investigatingSuperior HealthPlan, an insurance company that provides Medicaid coverage to adults and children and coverage for the Children’s Health Insurance Program in Texas, for allegedly using private investigators to perform surveillance and gather potentially confidential information on lawmakers, journalists and other Texans. “The allegations concerning Superior’s actions, such as actions that were characterized as potentially blackmailing lawmakers to secure state contracts and surveilling private citizens to avoid paying legitimate claims, are deeply troubling,” Paxton said in a statement. Superior HealthPlan CEO Mark Sanders wasquestioned Wednesdayby members of the Texas House Committee on the Delivery of Government Efficiency about his company’s use of private investigators. The topic surfaced as lawmakers questioned company representatives about potential fraud and waste of taxpayer funds connected to its Medicaid contracts, and Sanders told the committee members that the company used private investigators in the past, but hasn’t done so for the past few years. On Thursday, Superior fired Sanders, the Dallas Morning News reported. At Wednesday’s hearing, Sanders defended his company’s actions at the hearing by saying that the information gathered was nothing beyond what was publicly available.  “It was just understanding (what interests people), so we could have been knowledgeable of when we’re meeting with different individuals. That’s really it,” Sanders replied. Lawmakers expressed concern that the actions aimed to secure leverage to help the company win future state contracts, discredit legitimate insurance claims by individuals, and track journalists reporting on allegations against Superior HealthPlan. “I disagree. You wanted leverage, and you felt that you were going to use it. Just disgusting,” said state Rep.Tony Tinderholt, R-Arlington. State Rep. David Cook, R-Mansfield, asked Sanders that if there was no intent to gain leverage over people, why did private investigators working for Superior HealthPlan look into legislators’ divorce records? “I don’t recall at the time,” Sanders told lawmakers. House Bill 5061, filed by state Rep. Jeff Leach earlier this month, addresses some of the lawmaker’s concerns by prohibiting any contractor that works with the state from engaging in surveillance. “We’re up here talking to a company who has received millions, billions of dollars in taxpayer funds through Medicaid contracts, who has used that money to hire private investigators to follow around patients and legislators that are (now) asking questions about what the heck is going on,” said state Rep.Ellen Troxclair, R-Lakeway. “It’s ridiculous.” Tiffany Young, spokesperson for Texas Health and Human Services, referred questions on how the investigation could affect Texans’ Medicaid coverage to Paxton’s office. The attorney general’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon.

(AP Photo/John Locher)             NEW YORK (AP) — Dana White squeezed in a recent workout in New York — ahead of the launch of hisnew boxing promotion, just after he struck a YouTube deal forPower Slap, days ahead of the next majorUFC pay-per-view cardand around the time he celebrated making the cover of Forbes — when his phone buzzed in the gym from one of his closest confidants, the president. Hours before President Donald Trump addressed Congress, he texted White congratulations on becoming the latest cover boy for the business magazine that labeled the UFC CEO the “Populist Capitalist.” Their relationship dates to UFC’s infancy in White’s reign as he reorganized the company and led its rise into national prominence. Their alliance has yielded dividends for both parties — White stumped for Trump at Republican conventions while men who soak up fight nights threw their support behind Trump in the elections. It’s that kinship that prompted Trump to text White after the cover was released and even take Forbes to task for publishing the president’s name in the sub-headline. “You deserve the cover without having absolutely nothing to do with Trump,” White said, as he read the text exchange to The Associated Press. “I shouldn’t even be mentioned in the scheme of your tremendous success, so much as mentioned.” Maybe, but perhaps it’s telling that Trump’s rise politically mirrors that of UFC’s ascendance under White, two men whose style has served as a siren song for a segment of the population yearning for a return to the so-called traditional definition of a virile man, not just in the ring, but in life.  Kyle Kusz, a University of Rhode Island professor and author of “Revolt of the White Athlete: Race, Media and the Emergence of Extreme Athletes in America,” said Trump smartly latched onto UFC because White has posited the company as a safe space for “manly men.” “It kind of embodies the brutal, fight-to-the-finish way of being a man,” Kusz said. “It seems open to all sorts of men across different social categories, whether that’s class, whether that’s ethnicity, whether that’s race. It’s also open to women who are willing to be all-in on that way of thinking. Trump is cultivating that way of being to essentially train the population to fight for his reign.” White was grateful in his text reply to Trump, writing, “When they mention tribal business model, it’s really about loyalty and friendship, which is something people these days know nothing about. You and I are the poster boys for loyalty. Thank you for the kind words, Mr. President. But I have no problem being mentioned with you in any shape or form.” Yes, that’s right, White calls his long-time friend and former business associate from the days when Boardwalk cards at Trump Taj Mahal lifted UFC into relevancy, Mr. President. “I called him Don before he became President,” White said, laughing. “Now that he became President, I call him Mr. President.” Now, White, already the king of combat sports, may soon be called the final boss in boxing. TKO Group, the company that already houses WWE and UFC, entered into a partnership with Saudi Arabian businessmen to form the new, yet unnamed boxing venture that could provide the jolt of cash, infrastructure, and organized leadership the sport needs. TKO will serve as managing partner and run the day-to-day operations of the promotion expected to run its first card next year, but details are scarce beyond the initial announcement. The league needs a name — TKO is literally the low-hanging fruit there for the taking — a roster and a rights deal. Given the business acumen of the parties involved, and the hefty Saudi bankroll, those issues seem easily solvable and White’s input might be enough to prop boxing out of its niche status and into a mainstream sports player. Boxing retreated from the public sports consciousness in part because White and UFC exploited its inherent messiness to create a more coherent fight organization. It was WWE president and TKO board member Nick Khan who introduced White to Turki Alalshikh, chairman of the Saudi General Entertainment Authority, about 18 months ago to discuss collaborating on a boxing league. White had toyed with the idea of starting a boxing promotion and trying to fix a sport many believe long broken because of everything from corruption to decaying interest in the United States to the alphabet soup sanctioning bodies refusing to play nice and book the best fights. The 55-year-old White hit it off with Alalshikh and Saudi Arabia was eager to add to its sports portfolio. The Saudishost a Formula 1 auto race, fundLIV Golf, have hosted numerous pay-per-viewboxing cards— topped by Tyson Fury’s win over Francis Ngannou inOctober 2023— are in the midst of a10-year dealto hold WWE events and will host the 2034 World Cup in men’s soccer, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet in its sports expansion. Each marquee event only seems to push accusations against Saudi Arabia of “sportswashing,”an effort to rebrand a nation’s troubling public image that has been going onfor decades, using the Olympics and other sports across the globe, further into the background. Endeavor (the majority owner of TKO) and CEO Ari Emanuelreturned a $400 million investmentfrom the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund in 2019 after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Now, TKO is working with, among others, Sela, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The Saudis will fund the league, while TKO will run it. “So far, it’s been a great relationship,” White said. “I have to be aligned. I have to feel good about the relationship and these guys have kept their world and did everything they said they would do. Anything that happened with Saudi, pre-my deal, I didn’t have a relationship, I wasn’t with them.” White and TKO have the tools to turn the company into a winner. White — whom Forbes estimated to have a personal net worth north of $600 million — has cashed in on the current political climate and an audience that embraces the extreme no-excuses ideological masculinity that ushered Trump into the White House. Trump has leaned on UFC fights as both testosterone-charged campaign rallies andelection celebrationsand White and his fighters have come along for the ride. “A lot of the ways in which Trump wants to change culture, and to win at politics, he can express through connecting himself through sport, like UFC, because it does kind of promote manly man who are willing to be strong, be aggressive who are willing to fight for their side,” Kusz said. Much like loyalists seemed to tune out impeachment charges against Trump or even hisconviction on 34 felony countsin his historic hush money trial, the murky ethos of being bad has never been so good inside UFC. UFC fighters can seemingly act however they want and say whatever they want — see fighterBryce Mitchell’s recent defense of Adolph Hitleror Conor McGregor’s order by a civil jury to pay $250,000 to a woman who sayshe raped her— without any significant consequence levied by the company. “This is the fight business, man,” White said. “And then when you talk about races, religions, whatever you are, whoever you are, that’s what I’m selling. This is the fight business. At the end of the day, get over it. And if you can’t get over it, here’s my solution to you, don’t watch it.” In American sports leagues, Mitchell and McGregor would have faced lengthy suspensions or more severe consequences for their actions, the kind of punishments White — who wouldn’t evensanction himselffor an incident with his wife — no longer worries about dishing out. “We went through that early on, figuring out where we fit, who we were and all that stuff. Not anymore,” he said. “This is the fight business. People are going to say some stupid (stuff). People that you won’t necessarily agree with. Some bad thing will break out in their part of the world, and you hold all of them accountable for it and they can’t make a living? That’s never going to be us while I’m here. After I’m gone, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen.” And how long does White plan to keep running his mixed martial arts empire? “Until I die,” he said.

Can the ‘feel-good’ movie exist in 2025? ‘The Ballad of Wallis Island’ proves maybe it can,https://apnews.com/article/ballad-of-wallis-island-carey-mulligan-3a2031651ca7e86726729bddd354b8c7,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

But that’s not so easy when your movie is about a handful of people off the coast of Wales brought together by old songs. Yet one of many charms of“The Ballad of Wallis Island”is that it has no intentions of timeliness. It has nothing to do with “now,” which, in a way, might make it all the better suited to today. “Weirdly, it’s not a right-now movie, but that’s what makes it a right-now movie. Hopefully it’s heartwarming, and everything’s falling apart at the moment,” says Tim Key, who co-stars in and co-wrote the film with Tom Basden. “So I guess that’s a good thing.” “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” which Focus Features released Friday in theaters, stars Basden as Herb McGwyer, a famous folk musician turned pop star who, in the opening scenes, arrives at the rural seaside home of Charles (Key) for a private £500,000 ($647, 408) gig. After his chipper host helps him off the skiff and into the water (“Dame Judi Drenched,” Charles pronounces), Herb learns he’ll be performing for “less than 100” people. Just how significantly less unspools over the gentle, funny and sweetly poignant “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” the springtime movie release that may be most likely to leave audiences saying: “I needed that.” “Both of us have felt there’s a case to be made for stuff that isn’t relevant, that isn’t satirical, that isn’t a comment on the story of the day,” says Basden. “Those are the films that have meant the most to me over the years. They’re the ones that let me escape from the here and now. But it’s not always easy to get people to see it that way when you’re getting things made.”  “The Ballad of Wallis Island” is, itself, a product of time. It’s based on a 2007 short that Key and Basden made together when they, and director James Griffiths, were just starting out in show business. All three have since gone on to their respective, often overlapping careers. Key and Basden began in sketch comedy (their group was called the Cowards) and have been regular presences across offbeat British comedy. Key co-starred in Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge series and hosteda comic poetry hour radio showwith Basden providing musical accompaniment. Basden, who created the BBC sitcom “Here We Go,” has, among other things, written plays, including a riff on Franz Kafka’s “The Trial,” starring Key. When Basden and Key, now in their 40s, made 2007’s“The One and Only Herb McGwyer Plays Wallis Island,”they knew little of what lay ahead for them, let alone much about how to make a movie. “I don’t have any sort of discernable haircut,” says Key looking back. “I’m wearing my father’s cardigan.” But while the premise — the soggy collision between cynical star and lonely superfan — was thin, the concept of the BAFTA-nominated short stuck with Key, Basden and Griffiths. Griffiths, who moved on to directing series like “black-ish,” “Stumptown” and “Bad Sisters,” wanted to revisit the short during the pandemic. “Tim and Tom spent a lot of time in nature’s makeup chair. They’ve become the right age for the characters,” says Griffiths. “When we made the short, it was very much the idea of a sketch – an odd couple on an island. But over time, we’ve all grown up and as we’ve expanded on those characters, you start to see you’re commenting on your own lived experience.” In the script, Key and Basden decided to only slightly expand the cast, most notably creating the role of Nell Mortimer, the former folk singing partner of Herb’s. The arrival of Nell, played byCarey Mulligan,brings up much about Herb’s past as part of the duo known as McGwyer Mortimer, who represent an authenticity in music Herb lost long ago. For Charles, a genial pun-happy puppy dog of a man who says things like “Wowsers in your trousers,” McGwyer Mortimer’s music represents something nostalgic from an earlier relationship, too. “You can probably tell from our characters in the film that Tim has a much more positive energy than me, generally,” says Basden. “And I have absolutely leaned on his optimism over the years to counteract my natural pessimism. I count myself very lucky that I have Tim in my life for that reason alone. Mulligan, an executive producer on the film, didn’t hesitate to join despite, as Key says, “huge question marks over whether or not we could keep our composure with Carey Mulligan.” “I was a huge Tim Key fan and Tom (fan). We were obsessed with the late-night poetry hour,” says Mulligan, who’s married to folk star Marcus Mumford. “Before I even read it, my husband was like, ‘You’ve got to do it.’” Though Mulligan has starred in many films that speak more directly to their times (“She Said,” “Promising Young Woman,” “Suffragette”), she reveled in the the un-timeliness of “Wallis Island.” With it, Mulligan, a co-star in the Coen brothers’“Inside Llewyn Davis,”becomes the rare actor to appear in not one but two movies about dissolved folk duos. “It’s generous and it’s compassionate, and a reminder of what generosity can be and compassion can look like,” Mulligan says. “A big part of my attraction to it was its unseriousness and its lack of quote-unquote ‘importance.’ I was like, ‘I want to make something that’s just lovely.’” Griffiths, who grew up enamored of the films of Bill Forsyth, was inspired by the much-adored 1983“Local Hero,”which likewise centers around an outsider arriving on a far-away United Kingdom coastline. (In “Local Hero,” it’s Scotland.) Griffiths, who divorced in the intervening years, wanted to return to “Wallis Island” much as its characters are seeking to revive something from their past. “You look back and go: ‘Oh, I got here and I didn’t expect to be making this kind of work,’” says Griffiths. “I wanted to press the reset button a little bit and make something I really wanted to make.” How you make something sincerely heartwarming without tipping into over-sentimentality has bedeviled most Hollywood moviemakers for the better part of a century. In the case of “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” the key ingredient, perhaps, besides the abiding friendship of Key and Basden, was simply time. “There’s something about going back to a project you made 18 years earlier and then realizing you’re making a film about people who are obsessed with their life 15 years earlier,” says Basden. “You’re like: Hang on a minute. I haven’t used my imagination at all.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps)             WASHINGTON (AP) — Wisconsin’s spring election on Tuesday forstate Supreme Court, stateschools chiefand a proposed constitutional amendmentrequiring photo ID for votingwill be the first major indication of the state’s political climate since Republican Donald Trumprecaptured the White Housein November. Trump edged Democrat Kamala Harris in Wisconsin by just 0.86 percentage points, the tightest margin of any state. That narrow win, as well asa highly competitive 2023 state Supreme Court contest, could foreshadow the possible paths to victory for this year’s statewide campaigns. In the state Supreme Court race, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford and Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel look to replace outgoing Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, the court’s longest-serving member, who announced last April that shewould not seek a fourth 10-year term. Wisconsin Supreme Court seats are officially nonpartisan, but voters as well as the state’s party establishments routinely rally behind certain candidates based on their judicial philosophies and records. Crawford has the backing of Democrats and progressives, including an endorsement this week from former President Barack Obama. Schimel has support from Republicans and conservatives, includingendorsements from TrumpandElon Musk. Liberal-leaning justicesgained a 4-3 majorityon the court in 2023 for the first time in 15 years after Justice Janet Protasiewiczdefeated former Justice Dan Kellyfor a seat previously held by a conservative jurist. Bradley’s retirement gives conservatives an opportunity to retake the majority ahead of high-profile cases onabortion, unions and voting rights.  At the top of Tuesday’s ballot is the race for state superintendent of public instruction, the position responsible for managing Wisconsin’s 900,000-student, $9 billion public school system. Incumbent Jill Underly seeks a second four-year term against Brittany Kinser, an education consultant and founder of a state literacy initiative. While that role is also nonpartisan, Underly has the backing of the state Democratic Party and the state teachers’ unions, while Kinser is backed by the state Republican Party. Underly placed first in the Feb. 18 top-two primary with about 38% of the vote, followed by Kinser with about 34%. Another candidate with support mostly from Democrats placed third with about 27%, not enough to advance to Tuesday’s general election. Underly wasfirst elected in 2021with 58% of the vote against Republican-backed candidate Deborah Kerr. In any statewide election in Wisconsin, Democrats tend to win by large margins in the populous counties of Milwaukee and Dane (home of Madison), while Republicans win by wide margins in the smaller, more rural counties that stretch across most of the state. Republican candidates also tend to rely on strong showings in the WOW counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington in suburban Milwaukee, which help counter Democratic advantages in urban areas. Victory is determined by how big those margins are in the respective party strongholds, as well as which side can win over the state’s more competitive swing areas. In 2024, Harris, who was then vice president, won Milwaukee with 68% of the vote and Dane with 75%, while narrowly losing statewide. In comparison, Protasiewicz in her 2023 court race received 73% of the vote in Milwaukee and 82% of the vote in Dane. She went on to win statewide by an 11-percentage-point margin. Protasiewicz also won over about a dozen counties favorable to Trump, most notably in Brown County, home of Green Bay, which Trump carried in all three of his White House campaigns. The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. Recounts are not automatic in Wisconsin, but a trailing candidate may request one if the winning vote margin is less than a percentage point. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome. Here’s a look at what to expect Tuesday: The Wisconsin Spring Election will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET. The Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners for state Supreme Court, state superintendent of public instruction and the statewide ballot measure. Besides the statewide contests on the ballot, various local jurisdictions will also hold elections on Tuesday, but the AP will not be tabulating those contests. Any registered voter in Wisconsin may participate in the election on Tuesday. As of March 1, there were more than 3.8 million active registered voters in Wisconsin. Voters in the state do not register by party. About 1.8 million votes were cast in the 2023 spring election for state Supreme Court. That was 51% of registered voters and roughly 40% of the voting age population at the time. About 25% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day. As of Thursday, more than 475,000 ballots had been cast before Election Day. In the Feb. 18 primary, nearly 469,000 voters cast ballots in the race for superintendent, which was 12% of registered voters and roughly 10% of the voting age population at the time. The AP first reported results in the Feb. 18 primary at 9:04 p.m. ET, or about four minutes after polls closed. In both the 2023 spring election and the 2024 presidential election, the first results of the night posted at 9:11 p.m. ET. Election night tabulation ended at 12:02 a.m. ET in the Feb. 18 primary, at 2:30 a.m. ET in the 2023 spring election and at 5:47 a.m. ET in the November general election, all with more than 98% of the total vote counted.

What to do if you can’t pay the taxes you owe,https://apnews.com/article/taxes-irs-return-file-april-15-3da8f57a67c911fa67f18252a1be671e,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A page from the Internal Revenue Service website is shown on a laptop on Monday, April1, 2024 in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, file) This March 22, 2013, file photo shows the exterior of the Internal Revenue Service building in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)     NEW YORK (AP) — If you know or suspect you can’t pay thetaxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information or file for an extension. That’s the top piece of advice that tax professionals want you to know. “The IRS wants to work with you,” said Tom O’Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals. “But if you’re asking the IRS for some help, they have to know something about you. So the first thing is to have that return filed. The number one takeaway is that owing money is not a reason not to file.” If you don’t file a return or ask for an extension, then interest and penalties begin to accrue immediately. Those costs are largely avoidable if you share the information about your circumstances with the IRS in a timely way. Filing a return without paying taxes owed in full is preferable to not filing. To be clear, if you don’t pay all the taxes you owe by the April 15 filing deadline, interest will accrue even if you’ve been granted an extension to October, but that interest will be more manageable than fees that add up when you pay no taxes at all. “The worst case scenario is that you don’t file and end up being liable for penalties later on,” said Emily DiVito, senior advisor for economic policy at the nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative and former U.S. Treasury advisor. “That’s not good for anyone. But there are opportunities to ask for extensions and to go on payment plans.” Here’s what to know:  In addition to tacking on interest and penalties, the IRS can eventually garnish your wages, place a lien on your property, or even place a hold on your passport. But if you file for an extension, or if you file your return with your financial information, you can avoid these consequences. Even if you don’t have the money to pay what you owe in full by April 15, paying just a small part when you file. Yes.Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sitesacross the country are staffed with volunteers who will help you file a return or arrange for an extension for free. These volunteers can help you set up an installment payment plan of as many as 72 months to pay off any owed taxes. TheIRS Direct File programis also free to use. “While the question mark when you go to click the button to pay can be intimidating, we want to make sure that taxpayers get the money you’re owed, too,” said DiVito. “Most taxpayers — certainly most working taxpayers — get money back. But the way that a lot of the tax credits function, you only get that refund if you file your taxes in the first place.” If you’ve experienced unusual hardship, and you share that with the IRS, the IRS can sometimes put your account in “currently-not-collectible” status. To do that, you share information about your income and living expenses, and the IRS determines if you qualify. “Let’s say you’ve been ill, and you lost your job from illness, and you have serious medical bills. You’ve had all the bad luck, and things happened outside of your control, and you need some relief,” said O’Saben. “Then the IRS can place you in uncollectable status. But all of this requires conversation and communication. No one wants to admit they’re having economic problems, but the IRS will work with you if you do.” There are also rare circumstances in which the IRS will settle your tax debt for less than the amount owed, called an “offer in compromise.” VITA tax professionals can also help you see if you’re eligible, or you can usea free IRS tool online. That’s OK. Start now. “I’ve been doing taxes for more than 35 years,” said O’Saben. “The number one reason people don’t file is that they have a feeling they may owe — which could be wrong — and they don’t want to face it. But it’s not a problem that’s going to go away. So tell the IRS the truth of the situation. And they will work with you.” Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA and tax professional in California, echoed this. “It’s perfectly okay,” he said. “The IRS deals with every single taxpayer. They have dealt with this before. There’s nothing they haven’t seen.” The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

At least 144 people were killed in Myanmar, where photos and video from two hard-hit cities showed extensive damage. At least 10 died in the Thai capital, where a high-rise under construction collapsed.  The full extent of death, injury and destruction was not immediately clear —particularly in Myanmar, one of the world’s poorest countries. It isembroiled in a civil war, and information is tightly controlled.  “The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,” the head of Myanmar’s military government,Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaingsaid as he announced on television that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others were injured in his country.  In Thailand, Bangkok city authorities said 10 people were killed, 16 injured and 101 missing from three construction sites, including the high-rise.  The7.7 magnitude quakestruck at midday, with an epicenter near Mandalay,Myanmar’s second-largest city. Aftershocks followed, one of them measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude.  In Mandalay, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including one of the city’s largest monasteries. Photos from the capital city of Naypyidaw showed rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of multiple buildings used to house civil servants.  Myanmar’s governmentsaid blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept assistance. The United Nations allocated $5 million to start relief efforts.  But amid images of buckled and cracked roads and reports of a collapsed bridge and a burst dam, there were concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a humanitarian crisis.  “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,” said Mohammed Riyas, the International Rescue Committee’s Myanmar director.    Myanmar is in an active earthquake belt, though many of the temblors happen in sparsely populated areas, not cities like those affected Friday. The U.S. Geological Survey, a government science agency, estimated that the death toll could top 1,000.  Myanmar’s English-language state newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said five cities and towns had seen building collapses and two bridges had fallen, including one on a key highway between Mandalay. A photo on the newspaper’s website showed wreckage of a sign that read “EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT,” which the caption said was part of the capital’s main 1,000-bed hospital.  Elsewhere, video posted online showed robed monks in a Mandalay street, shooting their own video of the multistory Ma Soe Yane monastery before it suddenly fell into the ground. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed. Video also showed damage to the former royal palace.  Christian Aid said its partners and colleagues on the ground reported that a dam burst in the city, causing water levels to rise in the lowland areas.  Residents of Yangon, the nation’s largest city, residents rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. In Naypyitaw, some homes stood partly crumbled, while rescuers heaved away bricks from the piles of debris. An injured man reclined on a wheeled stretcher, while another man fanned him in the heat.  In a country where many people already were struggling, “this disaster will have left people devastated,” said Julie Mehigan, who oversees Christian Aid’s work in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.  “Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,” Mehigan said.  Myanmar’s military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones.  Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.    In Thailand, a 33-story building under construction crumpled into a cloud of dust near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market, and onlookers could be seen screaming and running in a video posted on social media. Vehicles on a nearby freeway came to a stop.  Sirens blaredacross the Thai capital’s downtown as a rescuers streamed to the wreckage. Above them, shredded steel and broken concrete blocks, some stacked like pancakes, rose in a towering heap. Injured people were rushed away on gurneys, and hospital beds were also wheeled outside onto a sidewalk.  “It’s a great tragedy,” Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said after viewing the site, adding that there was hope that there were still survivors.  The city’s elevated rapid transit system and subway shut down.  While the area is prone to earthquakes, they are usually not so powerful and rarely are felt in the Thai capital. The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 17 million people, many of whom live in high-rise apartments.  Voranoot Thirawat, a lawyer working in central Bangkok, said her first indication that something was wrong came when she saw a light swinging back and forth. Then she heard the building creaking, and she and her colleagues fled down 12 flights of stairs.  “In my lifetime, there was no earthquake like this in Bangkok,” she said.  Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland, was in one of Bangkok’s many malls when the quake struck.  “All of a sudden, the whole building began to move. Immediately, there was screaming and a lot of panic,” he said. Some people fled down upward-moving escalators, he said.  Nearby, Paul Vincent, a tourist visiting from England, recalled seeing a high-rise building swaying, water falling from a rooftop pool and people crying in the streets.  The U.S. Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ center for geosciences said the earthquake was a shallow 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to preliminary reports. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more damage.    To the northeast, the earthquake was felt in China’s Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused damage and injuries in the city of Ruili on the border with Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.  Videos that one outlet said were shot by a person in Ruili showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled in a stretcher toward an ambulance.  The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet.

The strike came after Israel, which accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields, warned residents to evacuate the area.  The area struck is a residential and commercial area and is close to at least two schools. This is a locator map for Lebanon with its capital, Beirut. (AP Photo)       Israeli officials said the attack was retaliation for rockets it said had been fired from Lebanon into northern Israel. They promised strikes on Beirut would continue unless Lebanon’s government worked to ensure such attacks ceased.  “We will not allow firing at our communities, not even a trickle,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “We will attack everywhere in Lebanon, against any threat to the State of Israel.”     Hezbollah denied firing the rockets, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.  Lebanon’s government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut’s southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.  Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day afterthe Oct. 7, 2023, attackon southern Israel by its Hamas allies ignited the war in Gaza. Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 in Israel and abducted 251 others during the 2023 attack.  The Israel-Hezbollah conflictexploded into all-out war last September when Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group’s senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.

(AP Photo/Hassan Ammar)   Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five border locations while carrying out dozens of strikes on what it said were Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon. Last week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.    Speaking in Paris, Lebanon’s President, Joseph Aoun, said the Beirut area strike was a continuation “of Israel’s violations of the agreement” sponsored by France and the U.S.  During a joint news conference with Aoun, French President Emmanuel Macron called the attack “unacceptable,” and promised to address it with Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump. Macron said that the U.S. can exert pressure on Israel.  The U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the escalation had created “a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region.”  Israeli strikes in other parts of Lebanon on Friday killed three people and wounded 18, including children and women, in the southern village of Kfar Tibnit, said Lebanon’s health ministry.

Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians.  Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns 59 hostages it still holds —24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.  Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.  Israel’s offensive in the Strip has killed over 50,000 people and wounded 114,000, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants.  The ministry said Friday that nearly 900 have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire ended in mid-March, including more than 40 over the past 24 hours.  ——————  Associated Press reporters Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Samuel Petrequin in Paris contributed to this report.

Do you eat a meal in 20 minutes or less? It might be time to slow down,https://apnews.com/article/eating-fast-tips-to-slow-down-4ba7e9760ac5903fe29dc38a4205d701,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Salmon poached in green salsa and topped with baked chips are displayed for a photo in Concord, N.H. (AP Photo/Matthew Mead, File) LONDON (AP) — You can have your cake and eat it too —just do it slowly. Experts tend to focus on the kinds of foods you can eat to improve your health. But the speed at which you devour your dinner matters just as much. There are risks with eating too fast — think stuck food and the potential to overeat before your brain tells you to stop. (Inhaling your food also risks annoying your slower-paced dining companions or the person who took the time to cook your meal.) Here are some tips from scientists on how to slow down and take a more mindful approach to consuming yourdiet. If you’re the kind of person who can regularly polish off breakfast, lunch or dinner in less than 20-30 minutes, you are eating too fast. “It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to communicate to the brain via a whole host of hormonal signals that it’s full,” said Leslie Heinberg, at the Center for Behavioral Health at the Cleveland Clinic. “So when people eat rapidly, they can miss these signals and it’s very easy to eat beyond the point of fullness.” People who eat quickly are likely to swallow more air, Heinberg said, which could lead to bloating or indigestion. Not chewing your food properly can also compromise digestion, meaning you won’t get all of the nutrients from your food. Unchewed pieces of food also could get stuck in your esophagus. Some previous studies have suggested that people who eat quickly have the highest risk ofobesity, while the slowest eaters were the least likely to be obese.  For starters, turn off the TV and put down your phone. “If you’re eating while you watch TV, people tend to eat until there’s a commercial or the show is over,” Heinberg said, adding that people are less inclined to pay attention to the body’s own signals that it’s full. “When we do things while we’re eating, we’re eating less mindfully. And that often causes us to eat more.” She said that when people focus exclusively on eating, they tend to enjoy the meal more and eat less. Heinberg also acknowledged the pace at which you eat is often an ingrained habit, but said change is still possible. She suggested things like using your non-dominant hand to eat, trying utensils you might not ordinarily use like chopsticks or taking a deliberate break to drink water when your plate is partially empty. If you have a busy life, it might be unavoidable to eat lunch at a work meeting or snack while running errands. But Sarah Berry, chief scientist at the British nutritional company ZOE, said when possible, “be mindful of what the food tastes and feels like.” “If we’re not fully present, it’s very easy to eat more quickly and not notice how much we’ve consumed,” Berry said. One of the simplest things to do is to increase the number of bites you take, said Helen McCarthy, a clinical psychologist with the British Psychological Society. “If you chew each mouthful a little bit longer, that will slow down your eating,” she said. The kind of food you eat may also make a difference, pointing out that it’s much easier to eatultraprocessedor fast foods quicker, because they typically have a softer texture. “It’s hard to eat vegetables and protein at the same rate as something that’s highly processed and requires less chewing,” McCarthy said. Some of her patients also reported an unintentional side effect once they began eating more slowly, referencing one woman who often ate a tube of potato chips every evening. When McCarthy told her to slow down and eat every single chip individually, her patient told her “it was like having a mouthful of claggy chemicals.” “She didn’t find (the chips) enjoyable anymore,” McCarthy said.

FACT FOCUS: A look at false and misleading claims made by Trump during his address to Congress,https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-trump-ukraine-3bea1df50167ac0a91f8c419b58c4b97,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. President Donald Trump’s one-hour and 40-minute address to Congress highlighted many of his initiatives, from an immigration crackdown to tariffs and energy policy. ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration President Donald Trump‘sTuesday night addressto a joint session of Congresshighlighted several of the initiativeshe’s started in his first six weeks in office, but many of his comments included false and misleading information. Here’s a look at the facts. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)  TRUMP: “Illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. Ever.” THE FACTS: Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday that Border Patrol apprehended 8,326 people on the U.S.-Mexico border last month. But U.S. government data show that Border Patrol routinely averaged below that number in the 1960s. While February marked the lowest arrest total in decades, Border Patrol averaged less than February 2025 for the first seven years of 1960s. The government website does not track U.S.-Mexico border totals before 1960. Border Patrol’s monthly average was 1,752 arrests in 1961.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  TRUMP: “Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members.” THE FACTS: That figure, which Trump cites regularly, is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 10.8 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through December 2024. But that’s arrests, not people. Under asylum restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests. There is no evidence other countries are sending their criminals or people with mental illness across the border, despite this frequent line from Trump.

(Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)  TRUMP: Citing alleged examples of what he described as “appalling waste” in the federal government, referenced ”$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.” THE FACTS: Trump appeared to be referencing a payment of $58.6 million — one of two the cityreceived last month. The payment was a federal reimbursement under the Shelter and Services Program, which was created to support local governments and non-government organizations that provide support to noncitizens released by immigration authorities. Liz Garcia, a city spokesperson, said at the time that these reimbursements included $19 million in claims for hotel costs. The two payments totaled over $80.5 million for services delivered between November 2023 and October 2024.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  TRUMP: “Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.” THE FACTS: Trump is banking on the idea that taxing imports is the road to riches for the United States. Most economists say Trump’s tariffswould hurt the country, as they’re tax increases that could raise the costs of goods in ways that could also harm economic growth. Trump suggests that the impact on inflation would be minimal. When the Yale University Budget Lab looked at thetariffs that Trump imposed Tuesdayon Canada, Mexico and China, it found that inflation would increase a full percentage point, growth would fall by half a percentage point and the average household would lose about $1,600 in disposable income. TRUMP: “Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. ... 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them, and we are searching right now.” THE FACTS: The databases may list those people, but that does not mean they are getting paid benefits. Democrats hold signs as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Part of the confusion comes from Social Security’s software system based on the COBOL programming language, which doesn’t use a specific format for dates. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization Wired first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration. Additionally, a series ofreportsfrom the Social Security Administration’s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these people were receiving benefits. The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million. As of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.

Scott Applewhite)  TRUMP: “Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.” THE FACTS: Inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022 under President Joe Biden, but Trump did not inherit a disastrous economy by any measure. The unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4% in January, the month he took office, while the economy expanded a healthy2.8% in 2024. Inflation-adjusted incomes have grown steadily since mid-2023. And inflation, while showing signs of stickiness in recent months and still elevated at3% in January, is down from its 2022 peak. Still, concern about the economy was akey driverbehind support for Trump during the 2024 election. The average price ofbasic consumer goodsin particular has seen major spikes in recent years. A dozen large eggs, for example, went from a low of $1.33 in August 2020 to $4.82 in January 2023. They decreased in price to $2.07 in September 2023, but are currently on the rise again, at $4.95 as of January.

(Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)  TRUMP: “We ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.” THE FACTS: Therewas no federal mandateto force the purchase of EVs, as Trump has falsely claimed many times before. Biden had set up a non-binding goal thatEVs make up half of new cars soldby 2030. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office revoking that goal. Biden’s policies tightened restrictions on pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks in an effort to encourage Americans to buy EVs and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars. TRUMP: “I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years.” THE FACTS: Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Army’s recruiting turnaround is tied to his time in office. In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total coming in August 2024 — before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers. A significant driver of the recruiting success was the Army’s decision to launch theFuture Soldier Prep Courseat Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)         WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is pushing the House of Representatives to pass a measure that would prevent immediate financial disaster for the District of Columbia even as he continues to level harsh criticism at the city and its leaders. In a Friday morning post on Truth Social, he wrote, “The House should take up the D.C. funding ‘fix’ that the Senate has passed, and get it done IMMEDIATELY.” It’s the first direct public indication from the Republican president that he supports efforts to restore a $1.1 billion hole in the district’s budget, and it’s a major boost for Democratic Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s campaign to reverse a legislative change that she says woulddevastate the capital city. Earlier this month, the House passeda federal government funding billthat would force the district’s government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its budget midway through the financial year. Bowser spearheaded an intense congressional lobbying campaign to prevent the change, saying it would result in immediate across-the-board cuts to staffing and programs, including teachers and police officers being laid off. The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut butimmediately followed upwith a separate bill that would make the district’s budget whole again. That measure now awaits House approval, and Bowser has delayed unveiling her 2026 budget plan until the issue is resolved.  Despite indications that Trump supported the budget fix, he had not publicly weighed in until now. The House adjourns for its spring recess on April 11, and House Republican leadership has remained vague on the topic, with Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana saying Tuesday that it was too early to confirm when the House would vote on the budget fix. “We’re working through that,” Johnson said. Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana said earlier this week that the district’s claim of financial ruin “sounds overstated.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Thursday that the April 11 recess provides a natural deadline and a sense of urgency. “It needs to happen before we go on the next district work period, which means it should occur either next week or the week after next,” Jeffries said. Speaking before Trump’s Friday posting, Jeffries said, “apparently even Donald Trump himself has expressed support for the need to correct this egregious error.” Trump’s endorsement of the budget fix comes amid a flurry of attention on the nation’s capital, with the president issuing a series of statements and executive orders targeting crime, homelessness, immigration policy and gun control in the district. On Thursday night, Trump issued an executive order establishing the inter-departmental D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force, which he said would coordinate with local officials on such things as enforcing federal immigration law, including deporting people living illegally in the city, boosting the law enforcement presence and increasing the speed and lowering the cost of processing applications to carry concealed weapons. “America’s capital must be a place in which residents, commuters, and tourists feel safe at all hours, including on public transit. Its highways, boulevards, and parks should be clean, well-kept, and pleasant,” the order stated. “Its monuments, museums, and buildings should reflect and inspire awe and appreciation for our Nation’s strength, greatness, and heritage.” And despite the support for the budget fix, Trump’s Friday morning posting also came with criticism of the nation’s capital and a warning: “We need to clean up our once beautiful Capital City, and make it beautiful again.” “We will be TOUGH ON CRIME, like never before,” Trump wrote. “I will work with the Mayor on this and, if it does not happen, will have no choice but to do it myself.” Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s non-voting delegate in the House, hailed Trump’s support for the budget fix and tied the issue into Washington’s longstanding and increasingly beleaguered campaign to become the 51st state. “As surprised as I am to have an occasion to agree with President Trump, in this instance, we agree that D.C. should be able to spend its own local funds at its own locally enacted levels,” Norton, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This ordeal, however, only helps to highlight the need for D.C. statehood so that D.C. can finally govern itself to the same extent afforded to the states, including making decisions about how to use its own local funds.” Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Kevin Freking and Leah Askarinam contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)            ISTANBUL (AP) — Two journalists were detained in dawn raids in Istanbul early Friday as part of a crackdown on media workers coveringTurkey’s largest protests in more than a decade, their outlets reported. Elif Bayburt, who works for the Etkin News Agency, and Nisa Suda Demirel, from the Evrensel news website, were the latest to be arrested in early morning sweeps that have targeted political activists and trade unionists as well as journalists. “Our reporter, Nisa Sude Demirel, was detained by the police who came to her house at around 6 a.m. this morning,” Evrensel said in a statement. “Demirel, who was following the (Istanbul City Hall) protests and the boycotts at the universities, was taken to the Istanbul Police Department’s Counter-Terrorism Branch office.” The demonstrations began last week following thearrest of Istanbul’s opposition Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Imamogluwas jailed pending trial on corruption chargesthat many see as politically motivated. The government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference. Reporters Without Borders condemned the journalists’ arrests. “There is no end to the detentions of journalists,” its Turkey representative Erol Onderoglu said. The Turkish Journalists’ Union called for the news media to be allowed to do its work and an “end to these unlawful detentions.”  Earlier this week, 11 journalists were detained in morning raids. Although initially jailed pending trial, they were freed Thursday but still face charges of “taking part in illegal rallies and marches.” Turkey’s broadcasting authority issued a 10-day airwave ban on Sozcu TV on Thursday, as well as fines and program suspensions to other opposition channels. A reporter from the U.K.'s BBC was also deported Thursday. The editor-in-chief of Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC said Friday that its reporter had gone missing. Joakim Medin has not been heard from since he wrote that he was being taken for questioning after arriving in Istanbul on Thursday to cover the protests, Andreas Gustavsson wrote on the paper’s website. Courthouses across Turkey are dealing with a spike in cases as a result of the protests. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said Thursday that nearly 1,900 people had been arrested since March 19. Anxious families have been gathering outside court buildings to await the fate of their loved ones, who police can hold for four days. “The youth we call Generation Z are more likely to participate in these protests. They sense that something is wrong,” Savas Ozbek, whose daughter was detained Sunday, told ANKA News Agency outside Ankara Courthouse late Thursday. Zeynep Ulger, who was waiting for news of her friend, said they were protesting for a “free, democratic country,” adding: “The only thing we have achieved in the face of this is being beaten by the police on the streets and being detained.” Istanbul-based lawyer Arif Anil Ozturk, who represents many detained protesters, gave his insight into court proceedings. “It is an unlawful process from beginning to end,” he told the Cumhuriyet newspaper. “There is no evidence, no footage. Children… are being treated like terrorists.” Nightly Istanbul rallies organized by Imamoglu’s Republican People’s Party, or CHP, ended Tuesday. In other cities, and in Istanbul since the end of the CHP gatherings, largely peaceful protests have been more organic. Police, however, have used tear gas, water cannon and plastic pellets to suppress demonstrations that have been banned in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. At the Middle East Technical University campus on the outskirts of the capital Ankara, nine students were detained early Friday, opposition politicians who visited the site said. “Young people have set up tents inside (the campus). Officious administrators have evaluated this situation as a ‘threat’ and invited the police to the university to conduct an operation,” CHP Provincial Chairperson Umit Erkol said on social media. Aylin Yaman, a CHP member of parliament, said students were sitting on the grass and singing when police stormed the area at 2 am. “We object to the police entering here as if it were a dawn operation and creating an atmosphere of fear,” she said. The Istanbul Bar Association announced that three lawyers had been among some 100 people arrested at a Thursday demonstration in the city’s Sisli district. Lawyers also said they had been kept waiting for hours outside police headquarters to gain access to detainees. Following the overnight arrest of Imamoglu’s lawyer Mehmet Pehlivan, it was revealed Friday that he is accused of money-laundering. Imamoglu, in a social media post, said Pehlivan had been “detained on fictitious grounds.” He was later released on condition of judicial control. Turkey’s Nobel-winning author Orhan Pamuk, writing in several European newspapers, said events over the past 10 days represented “Erdogan’s strong-fisted, autocratic rule (at) a level we have not seen before.” Following a meeting with Turkey’s foreign minister earlier in the week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described events in Turkey as “disturbing.” Speaking on a return flight from Suriname late Thursday, he said: “We are concerned, we don’t like to see the direction that’s going... Anytime you have instability on the ground you don’t like to see it.” A group of European politicians arrived in Istanbul to show support to Imamoglu and meet opposition figures. Led by former Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, the delegation from the Party of European Socialists also included European Parliament Vice President Katarina Barley. “This is not just about one person. This is about democracy, and we are here to stand up for democratic values,” Lofven said. “These politically motivated accusations are a threat to democracy in Turkey.” In a TV interview Friday, the co-leader of the pro-Kurdish DEM Party appeared to offer qualified support for the protests. “We are not the CHP’s activist group. We support them but we will not take to the streets for this,” Tuncer Bakirhan said. Commentators have suggested that therecent peace initiativeoffered to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, is a bid by Erdogan to lure the DEM Party, which is the third-largest in parliament, into supporting an extension of his presidency beyond his current term. Imamoglu faces charges stemming from two investigations into the opposition-controlled Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality – a corruption case and one alleging support for terrorism. The mayor has been confirmed as the CHP’s presidential candidate in an election currently scheduled for 2028 but which is likely to take place earlier. He has performed well in recent polls against Erdogan, and his election as mayor of Turkey’s largest city in 2019 was a major blow to the president. —- Associated Press writers Matthew Lee in Miami and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Darrion Williams could barely make a shot for the first 30 minutes. He didn’t miss when it mattered most, sending Texas Tech to an improbable spot in the Elite Eight. Williams scored the go-ahead basket with 7.3 seconds left in overtime aftertying the game with a 3-pointerin the closing seconds of regulation to lead Texas Tech to an 85-83 win over Arkansas on Thursday night. “The heart of the team is Darrion Williams,” coach Grant McCasland said. “He just is a resilient guy. I can’t even explain it. I put faith in him because I do believe that he’ll find a way in one-game scenarios to do whatever it takes to win. I honestly do. Whatever it takes.” The first overtime game of March Madness came thanks to a furious comeback by the third-seeded Red Raiders (28-8) from 13 points down with less than 5 minutes left against coach John Calipari’s 10th-seeded Razorbacks (22-14). Texas Tech advanced to play top-seeded Florida in the West Region final on Saturday with a chance at the school’s second Final Four trip after losing the title game to Virginia in 2019. That idea seemed far-fetched for most of this game as Arkansas broke out to a double-digit lead early and was in control most of the way, leading by as many as 16 points in the second half. “In the huddle, Coach said we’re going to find a way to win this no matter how much we’re down,” guard Christian Anderson said. “As a team we had that look, we’re not losing this game no matter what. ... We had to find a way to make it happen. And at the end we did, so that was it.”  Williams helped will the Red Raiders down the stretch after opening the game by missing 13 of his 15 shots in front of a large contingent of his friends and family that came from Sacramento for the game. But the Red Raiders closed regulation with a 16-3 run behind three 3-pointers from Anderson and three baskets from Williams. The biggest came when he rattled in a 3 with 9.7 seconds left after Jonas Aidoo had missed the front end of a one-and-one. Williams had missed eight of his first nine attempts from 3 before that make. “Obviously they weren’t going in, but I was shooting open ones”, Williams said. “They’ll fall.” JT Toppin then scored to start overtime and give Texas Tech its first lead since the opening minutes and it went back and forth from there, with D.J. Wagner tying it for Arkansas with 34 seconds left. Williams then scored down low to give Texas Tech the lead and Wagner’s last shot hit the front rim, sending the Red Raiders into a wild celebration at midcourt as Williams pointed to the crowd following the second biggest comeback in Sweet 16 history. Calipari could only walk off the court with pursed lips and a sigh as his first season at Arkansas ended in heartbreak after he fell just short of being the first coach to take four schools to the Elite Eight. “We’re all disappointed here,” Calipari said. “But I told them, there’s nothing them individually or my team could do to disappoint me because of what they’ve done this year. I’m so proud of them.” Anderson scored 22 points to lead Texas Tech, while Toppin and Williams added 20 apiece. Johnell Davis scored 30 points for the Razorbacks and Karter Knox added 20. The Red Raiders were missing a key player once again with top outside shooterChance McMillian missing his fourth straight gamewith an oblique injury. McMillian, who grew up in San Francisco, had been hoping to play in his homecoming game but was ruled out before tipoff. Arkansas got forward Adou Thiero back for the first time since he injured his left knee on Feb. 22. Thiero played five minutes.

Trump and newly minted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney share a phone call,https://apnews.com/article/canadian-prime-minister-mark-carney-trump-3dce332dc2c4b1cb9d034f70ef2920ff,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks with media on Parliament Hill following a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Canada-U.S. Relations and National Security, in Ottawa, Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday his first call with newCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carneywas “extremely productive” and Carney said talks on a new relationship will begin after the Canadian election next month. The call came asTrump has declared a trade war on Canadaand has threatened to use economic coercion to make Canada the 51st U.S. state,a position that has infuriated Canadians. Trump avoided any mention of that in his social media post. The U.S. president, in his post, said they “agree on many things and will be meeting immediately after Canada’s upcoming Election to work on elements of Politics, Business, and all other factors, that will end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada.” Trump later called the prime minister by his first name Mark and said Carney called him. “We are going to end up with a very good relationship with Canada,” Trump said. “I think things are going to work out very well between Canada and the United States.” Carney’s office said in a statement they will begin comprehensive negotiations for a “new economic and security relationship” immediately after the Canadian election on April 28. Carney, who replacedJustin Trudeauas Canada’s leader and the head of the Liberal Party, is at the start of a five-week campaign. The former central banker was sworn in as Canada’s new prime minister on March 14. It’s unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.  Trump ramped up his trade war this week by announcing a 25% tariff on automobile imports. Autos are Canada’s second largest export. Trump previously placed 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as on all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. “The Prime Minister informed the President that his government will implement retaliatory tariffs to protect Canadian workers and our economy, following the announcement of additional U.S. trade actions on April 2, 2025,” Carney’s office said. The statement said the two leaders agreed that Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s minister of international trade, and United States Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, will intensify talks to address immediate concerns in the interim. Carney previously said he would talk to Trump if he respected Canada’s sovereignty. The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war and challenged Canada’s sovereignty. The crisis has created a surge in patriotism among Canadians, with many in the country feeling that Carney is the best person to lead the country at the moment. Trump previously acknowledged that he has upended Canadian politics. Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved. This image provided by Eli Lilly shows the company’s new Alzheimer’s drug Kisunla. (Eli Lilly and Company via AP) A European regulatory committee rejected Eli Lilly’s U.S.-approvedAlzheimer’s disease treatmentover potentially dangerous risks of brain bleeding and swelling. The European Medicines Agency committeesaidthe benefits of the new drug, Kisunla, did not outweigh the risks, and it recommended refusing marketing authorization for it. The agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use said Lilly can ask for a re-examination of its opinion. Lilly said Friday that it hopes discussions about the drug continue with the agency through re-examination. The Indianapolis drugmaker noted that Kisunla has already been approved in Japan and China, among other markets. U.S. regulators approved Kisunla last July for mild or early cases of dementia caused by the fatal, mind-robbing disease. That came a year after they approved a similar drug, Leqembi, from Japanese drugmaker Eisai. The drugs are the first to show a delay in cognitive decline in patients, but it amounts to a matter of months. The European committee alsosaid last summerthat Leqembi should not receive marketing authorization due to some of the same concerns. But itreversed its decisiona few months later. Both Kisunla and Leqembi are laboratory-made antibodies, administered by IV, that target one contributor to Alzheimer’s — sticky amyloid plaque buildup in the brain. Questions remain about which patients should get the drugs and how long they might benefit. Shares of Eli Lilly and Co. climbed more than $2 to $823.99 Friday morning.

All Rights Reserved. In this image provided by The Myanmar Military True News Information Team, Myanmar’s military leader Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, center, inspects damaged road caused by an earthquake Friday, March 28, 2025, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. (The Myanmar Military True News Information Team via AP) Even before a powerful 7.7-magnitude quake hitMyanmaron Friday, more than 3 million people in the country had been displaced, and hundreds of thousands were cut off from vital food and health programs as a result of a destructive four-year civil war that international groups claim has indiscriminately targeted civilians. Social media videos depicted widespread destruction after the earthquake hit an epicenter near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, and was followed by a strong 6.4-magnitude aftershock, raising fears that many were trapped under the rubble or killed. Information and movement throughout the country remain very tightly controlled, making it more difficult for any rescue efforts or even an assessment of the official death toll. Here’s a brief look at Myanmar: THE BASICS: Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was already embroiled in turmoil since the armyseized power from the elected governmentof Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, 2021, triggering widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms. Large parts of the country are now entangled in conflict. Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the late 2023 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border.  MANY DISPLACED: Before the quake struck, the United Nations estimated that hundreds of thousands of civilians had been displaced by internal fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, with some 18.6 million people in need of humanitarian aid. However, access issues and recent cuts to foreign assistance have devastated the already war-torn country. A 90-day freeze on foreign assistance programs announced earlier this year by U.S. President Donald Trump has led to other cuts in services for refugees from Myanmar, including the shutdown of hospital care in camps in neighboring Thailand where more than 100,000 are living,according to activists and Thai officials. HUNGER A CHIEF CONCERN: A recentstatement by the World Food Programsaid that most food rations currently distributed in Myanmar will be cut off in April, even as the country faces a desperate humanitarian crisis. The WFP said it would need $60 million to continue food assistance in Myanmar and called on its partners to identify additional funding. The WFP said 15.2 million people, nearly one-third of the total population, are unable to meet their minimum daily food needs, and some 2.3 million face emergency levels of hunger. The organization said it only has the funding right now to assist 35,000 of the most vulnerable people, including children under the age of 5, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and people living with disabilities. HEALTH CHALLENGES: Last week, Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, laid out the dire health crisis as a result of the drying up of aid. Tuberculosis and HIV patients have been missing their medication for weeks; disabled children have been locked out of rehabilitation centers; rights groups have faced cuts in their ability to distribute food and water to people, Andrews said.

(AP Photo/Brian Inganga)                     KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) —Tensions are risingin the oil-rich east African nation ofSouth Sudanafter Riek Machar, who serves as one of the country’s vice presidents, was arrested in the capital. Machar’s arrest in Juba on Wednesday followeddetentions of his alliesin the government and the army, including the army’s deputy chief. Machar’s political group said Thursday that a 2018 agreement that’s the basis forrelative peaceafter a brutal civil is effectively over, raising fears of a return to warfare as government troops loyal to President Salva Kiir battle soldiers and armed militia loyal to Machar. Here’s a look at the issues underpinning the conflict inSouth Sudan: Both Kiir and Machar are historical leaders of the rebel movement — the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, or SPLM — that secured South Sudan’s independence from Sudan in 2011. But they are from rival ethnic groups: Kiir is from the Dinka, the largest, and Machar is from the Nuer, the second-largest. Their military rivalry began in the 1990s, when Machar led a breakaway unit that drew accusations of treachery against him. Amid the split, forces loyal to Machar carried outa massacre in the town of Borthat targeted the Dinka, angering rebel commander Kiir and John Garang, the movement’s now-deceased political figurehead. Fighting among southerners briefly undermined their struggle for independence, but it also planted lifelong distrust between Kiir and Machar.  Analysts say Machar and Kiir don’t see eye to eye even as they work together, and their feud has grown over the years as Machar waits his turn to become president and Kiir hangs on in the presidency. In 2013, citing a coup plot, Kiir fired Machar as his deputy, and later that year violence erupted in Juba as government soldiers loyal to Kiir fought those devoted to Machar in the start of a civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people. Machar has served as South Sudan’s No. 2 official on and off since 2011. But there have been no elections since then, keeping him in the deputy’s position and without real executive authority. Machar’s wish is to become president in fulfilment of a century-old prophecy by a seer from his tribe who predicted that a man with a gap between his front teeth and left-handed would one day lead the nation. Machar, who has three university degrees, believes himself to be that man. The superstition can seem odd, but many people see it as one factor fueling Machar’s ambitions. Tensions between Machar and Kiir have grown with the repeated postponement of elections in South Sudan. A vote is now scheduled for December 2026, security conditions allowing, and Machar is expected to be a candidate. He describes Kiir as a dictator, saying his unilateral political maneuvers, including firing officials, undermine the peace agreement that brought them together in a government of unity. The agreement, signed with the support of the U.S. and others, included security guarantees for Machar to be able to return to Juba as Kiir’s deputy. Fighters loyal to him are located at different sites in the country, and a key element of the agreement was the envisaged creation of a unified army command that incorporates soldiers loyal to Machar. But efforts in this direction have been slow, and Kiir has been accused of undermining the process by making irregular military recruitments and purging army officers deemed not to be faithful to him. Machar is also at a disadvantage in the contest with Kiir because he doesn’t control the internal security apparatus, much of which is informal. A major escalation of tensions happened in March when a Nuer militia, known as the White Army, seized an army garrison in Nasir, a town in Upper Nile state that’s a stronghold of Machar. Later, whena U.N. helicopterwent to rescue government troops stranded there, it was attacked. Dozens were killed, including a miliary general who was the top commander of government troops there. While the violence is still largely restricted to Upper Nile, “the tinder is dangerously dry elsewhere,” according to the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is Kiir’s key ally. In 2013, when the conflict first emerged, Museveni deployed Ugandan special forces who foiled attempts by Machar’s forces to take power in Juba. Museveni has deployed troops again this time, in defiance of a U.N. arms embargo on South Sudan, but potentially helping to avoid an escalation of fighting between the warring parties. The Ugandan military says the deployment was in fact aneffort to keep the peace process intactby firming up Kiir over Machar. Kiir also controls the National Security Service, or NSS, the dreaded domestic spy agency whose agents are authorized to make arrests without warrants. The agency reports to the president, who routinely shuffles its leaders. The NSS is “a vital tool in the government’s campaign of silencing dissent,” according to New York-based Human Rights Watch. The Sentry, a Washington-based watchdog, says of the NSS that it “stands out as particularly ruthless, secretive, and well-funded. Fear of the NSS is pervasive in South Sudan, and for good reason.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

ChatGPT’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images highlight AI copyright concerns,https://apnews.com/article/studio-ghibli-chatgpt-images-hayao-miyazaki-openai-0f4cb487ec3042dd5b43ad47879b91f4,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Hayao Miyazaki of Japan, director of the animated film “Ponyo,” poses at a special screening of the film in Los Angeles on July 27, 2009. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File) LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind “Spirited Away” and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style ofGhibli founder Hayao Miyazaki. But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI’s role in animation. Janu Lingeswaran wasn’t thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT’s new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as “My Neighbor Totoro” or “Kiki’s Delivery Service.” “I really fell in love with the result,” said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. “We’re thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.” Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkishpistol shooter Yusuf Dikecin a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed “Disaster Girl” meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.  ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which isfighting copyright lawsuitsover its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the “Ghiblification” experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a “conservative approach” in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists. “We added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,” it said. But the company added in a statement that it “permits broader studio styles — which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.” Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday. As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki’s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was “utterly disgusted” by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could “present us grotesque movements that we humans can’t imagine.” It could be used for zombie movements, the person said. That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story. “Every morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,” Miyazaki said. “It’s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can’t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can’t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.” He said he would “never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.” “I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,” he added. Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli’s work. That in turn “raises the question of, ‘Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?’” he said. OpenAI didn’t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license. Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be “problematic.” Weigensberg said that there is a general principle “at the 30,000-foot view” that “style” is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say “style” could be “more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,” he said. “A ‘Howl’s Moving Castle’ or ‘Spirited Away,’ you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,” he said. “Just stopping at, ‘Oh, well, style isn’t protectable under copyright law.’ That’s not necessarily the end of the inquiry.” Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki’s movies and issuing other AI image generatorsfor copyright infringement in a case that’s still pending, called it “another clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.” “That’s using Ghibli’s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,” Ortiz said. “It’s an insult. It’s exploitation.” Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump’s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House’s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made. “To see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki’s work be butchered to generate something so foul,” Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues “the hell out of” OpenAI for this. —————- O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

(AP video shot by Hau Dinh/ production by Annika Wolters)                HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The taste of banh te — a steamed rice cake with an enticing filling of mushrooms and minced pork — captures the quintessence of northern Vietnamese cuisine: Humble ingredients, prepared perfectly and often enjoyed with a funkyfish saucedip.  This balance of flavors is what Quang Dung, the chef and owner of Chapter Dining in Hanoi, sought in his modern take on the dish. His version of banh te is unapologetically fancy. The steamed rice cake is enriched with pork stock and served with a raw scallop and pickled daikon shavings. Freshness comes from coriander used several ways, sweetness from fried shallot oil, and a delicate floral essence extracted from a giant water bug used in northern Vietnamese cooking.  And then, a splash of fish sauce — or nuoc mam — brings it all together in a savory broth that suffuses the dish.  “Fish sauce is one of the foundations for flavor,” he said. Dishes made with fish sauce are prepared at Chapter Dining, a fine dining restaurant, on March 1, 2025, in Hanoi, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   It’s also the basis for Vietnam’s diverse and vibrant cuisine. Just a drop of the amber liquid can transform a dish by boosting umami and savory notes. Made by fermenting fish — often anchovies that are getting harder to catch because of climate change — in salt for many months, the taste of each bottle varies depending on factors like the ratio of salt to fish or the length of fermentation.  Fish sauce is a staple across Vietnam, used in a variety of dishes. As a dipping sauce for spring rolls or savory crepes called banh xeo. In marinades for grilled meat dishes like Hanoi’s pork and noodle classic called bun cha. In salad dressings and in braised meat dishes like the southern classic where pork is cooked in bittersweet caramel and fish sauce. Much of Vietnam’s cuisine is shaped by the decades of hardship during and after the Vietnam War, but today its economy and its cities are booming. And fish sauce is finding its way into unusual applications.  A speciality cocktail made with fish sauce is displayed at the Liquid Store, on Feb. 19, 2025, in Hanoi, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   In Hanoi, fish sauce is used in some cocktails to add umami, and Dung has used it to add a Vietnamese twist to French hollandaise sauce and even flavor ice cream.  “It is very versatile,” he said. “A lot of fun to use and to explore.”  Dung’s culinary explorations began early. His mother taught him to cook at 10 so he could feed himself while his banker parents worked long hours. He learned how to make rice, fry eggs, and boil vegetables. Soon after, he was braising pork and making spicy fried rice. Growing up, he assumed everyone could cook — after all, his friends in Hanoi could. But it wasn’t until he moved to the United Kingdom as a teenager to finish high school that he realized this wasn’t the case.  He eventually studied finance in coastal Devon, but while working part-time in restaurants, he fell in love with all things food: learning from his peers, consuming cookbooks by top chefs, and spending all his savings to eat out at restaurants. “When you’re 18, you’re a sponge. You absorb everything,” he said. Fish sauce is an indelible part of Vietnam’s culture and essential for its vibrant cuisine. In small fishing villages across Vietnam’s long coast, families have made it for centuries but climate change and overfishing threaten the anchovies crucial for fish sauce production. (AP video shot by Hau Dinh/ production by Annika Wolters)  He came back to Vietnam in 2013 and got a job working in a bank. But every evening, he worked a second job — as a junior chef for a five-star hotel in Hanoi at night. He eventually quit both jobs in 2015 and started a gastropub in Hanoi. That didn’t go according to plan as he “managed to do everything wrong.” More failures followed — he calls them “lessons in my dictionary” — but in 2021 he opened Chapter Dining, a fine dining restaurant in the heart of Hanoi’s Old Quarter that celebrates local, seasonal produce and the cooking traditions of Vietnam’s mountainous north.  The restaurant, with its facade of steel slats, leads to an open kitchen where Dung and his team regularly create a 14-course tasting menu that won it a spot in the coveted Michelin Guide Hanoi in 2023 and 2024.  “I can finally call it ... my restaurant, my food, my philosophy,” he said.  Central to that philosophy is sustainability. Each menu is seasonal — warm, comforting dishes for the cold months and fresh, lighter dishes in the summer — and the ingredients are locally sourced. Given the erratic weather in the climate-vulnerable country, this means that he can’t always be sure of what produce will be available. So the menu adapts, letting nature decide, and the bottle of fish sauce is never too far away.  “Fish sauce isn’t just about saltiness. It is as much about umaminess. It is magic,” he said, adding that he hoped more people would cook with fish sauce.  A good starting point, he suggested, is to use it to add a bit of that magic to the humble omelet. Three eggs, two teaspoons of fish sauce, a heap of finely diced spring onions all beaten together. Add pork fat to a hot pan and roll the eggs around.  “And then you’ve got a very nice fish sauce omelet. That goes down really well with rice,” he said.

Two law firms targeted by Trump sue over executive orders that sought to punish them,https://apnews.com/article/trump-law-firm-mueller-fc64fcda098b52756294c3d6a3b3d998,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. President Donald Trump speaks at an education event and executive order signing in the East Room of the White House in Washington, March 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Two prominent law firms targeted bythe White Housesued Friday over virtually identical executive orders, pushing back over edicts meant to punish them over their association with attorneys who have previously investigated President Donald Trump. The federal complaints filed by Jenner & Block and WilmerHale urge judges to block enforcement of the orders, which seek among other sanctions to suspend security clearances of the firms’ lawyers and restrict their employees from having access to federal buildings. The firms say in their lawsuits that the orders, part of a spate of similar actions taken by Trump over the past month, amount to an assault on the bedrock foundations of the legal system and are an unconstitutional form of presidential retaliation. “Our Constitution, top to bottom, forbids attempts by the government to punish citizens and lawyers based on the clients they represent, the positions they advocate, the opinions they voice, and the people with whom they associate,” said the complaint from Jenner & Block, filed in federal court in Washington. The firms say the days-old orders have already affected their business, with Jenner & Block saying that one client has been notified by the Justice Department that the firm cannot attend a meeting at the building next week. “That client therefore will either need to attend the meeting without outside counsel or would need to retain new outside counsel before April 3,” the lawsuit says.  Targeted law firms have taken different approaches to executive orders that threaten to upend their business model and chill their legal practice. Besides the two that sued on Friday,the law firm of Perkins Coie, also challenged the Trump order in court and succeeded in getting a judge to temporarily block enforcement. The Paul Weiss firm, by contrast,cut a deal with the White Housedays after being targeted, with its chairman saying that the order presented an “existential crisis” for the firm and that he wasn’t sure it could have survived a protracted fight with the Trump administration. The executive order against Jenner & Block this week stemmed from the fact that the firm once employed Andrew Weissmann, a lawyer who served onspecial counsel Robert Mueller’s teamthat investigated Trump during his first term in office. Weissmann left the firm four years ago. Mueller has retired from WilmerHale, but the White House executive order from Thursday mentions him as well as another retired partner and a current partner who all served on Mueller’s team. “While most litigation requires discovery to unearth retaliatory motive, the Order makes no secret of its intent to punish WilmerHale for its past and current representations of clients before the Nation’s courts and for its perceived connection to the views that Mr. Mueller expressed as Special Counsel,” the WilmerHale lawsuit says.

(AP Photo/Rob Gray)     TheMemphis Grizzliesfired Taylor Jenkins, their winningest coach, on Friday with the team struggling down the stretch and at risk of losing home-court advantage for the postseason. Still sitting at No. 5 in the Western Conference standings, the Grizzlies decided to dump Jenkins anyway without immediately announcing an interim coach. Jenkins led the Grizzlies for six seasons. He was let go with the team on the verge of playing three home games in a four-day span starting Saturday — first the Lakers, then Boston on Monday, then Golden State on Tuesday. That starts a stretch where eight of Memphis’ final nine opponents are either playoff clubs or contending for a play-in spot. But it’s still possible, at least mathematically, that Memphis could get back to No. 2 in the West, and it’s highly unlikely that the Grizzlies will fall into the play-in tournament range. Still, Memphis decided it was time for a change. “This was a difficult decision, given the consistent and tangible development of our players and overall success under Taylor’s leadership,” Zach Kleiman, the Grizzlies’ president and general manager of basketball operations, said in a statement. The Grizzlies will not be practicing Friday and announced no media availability. Jenkins was the fifth longest-tenured coach with his current club in the league, behind only San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, Miami’s Erik Spoelstra, Golden State’s Steve Kerr and Denver’s Michael Malone — all of them having won NBA titles.  Results against the league’s best teams so far this season weren’t a good sign for Jenkins. The Grizzlies were 0-4 against Oklahoma City, losing those games by 24, 13, 17 and 21 points. They’re 3-6 so far this season against Houston, Denver and the Lakers, the next three teams ahead of them in the West. And that’s been a trend all season for Memphis. The Grizzlies were really good against the sub-.500 teams, but struggled mightily against the winning clubs. Against the 13 other teams that currently are over .500, the Grizzlies are 11-20 this season and getting outscored by 77 points. Against the 16 clubs at .500 or worse, the Grizzlies are 33-9, outscoring those opponents by 462 points. Jenkins, with a career record of 250-214, passed Lionel Hollins for most wins in franchise history Nov. 20 with a victory against the Philadelphia 76ers. He also coached the most games in Grizzlies’ history, with the franchise launching in 1995. He took Memphis to the postseason three times during his tenure but only got to the second round once. In the 2021-22 season, the team won 56 games for the Grizzlies’ most in a season under Jenkins. The Grizzlies captured the Southwest Division and were a No. 2 seed in the West. They ousted the Minnesota Timberwolves in the opening round, but lost toGolden State in the secondwith star Ja Morant dealing with an injury. Jenkins replaced J.B. Bickerstaff, who was fired after failing to make the playoffs in the 2018-19 season. He had served as an assistant with the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks, both working for coach Mike Budenholzer. He also served a stint in the San Antonio Spurs organization, eventually becoming head coach of the Spurs G League team in Austin. Jenkins’ arrival in Memphis coincided with the Grizzlies draftingMorantwith the No. 2 overall pick in 2019. Memphis made the postseason three straight seasons from 2021 to 2023. Then the Grizzlies went through a season plagued with injuries to major players. Morant played only nine games because of a25-game league suspensionand aright shoulder injurythat ended his season. Fellow guard Desmond Bane missed considerable time with a left ankle sprain, and frontline reserve Brandon Clarke managed only six games because of a left Achilles tendon tear. That left Jenkins to manage the season with forward Jaren Jackson Jr. and a bunch of makeshift lineups, eventually finishing 27-55. This season, Jenkins turned over his coaching staff and brought in a new offense based on spacing. Despite being plagued with turnovers, Memphis spent a large part of the season second in the West. Other teams surged as the Grizzlies’ rough patch dropped them to fifth place. Again, Jenkins spent another season piecing together lineups around Morant limited to 43 games with various illnesses, soreness, contusions and sprains. Morant missed Thursday night’s game,his sixth straight, with a strained hamstring. AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds and AP freelance writer Clay Bailey contributed to this report.

IRS crime fighting arm announces modernization program as financial crimes use more tech,https://apnews.com/article/bank-secrecy-act-irs-criminal-investigations-342ea3261a0c62901b854fd29ecdc580,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A sign for the Internal Revenue Service building in Washington, on May 4, 2021. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — As the nature offinancial crimechanges, with technology and AI increasingly used to perpetrate illegal acts, the IRS’ crime fighting arm —IRS Criminal Investigation— is announcing a new program intended to improve how it interacts with financial institutions. Called Feedback in Response to Strategic Threat —or CI-FIRST— the program unveiled Friday is intended to speed up subpoena requests, give banks better data on how to detect criminal activity and build out investigations faster and more efficiently. Under theBank Secrecy Act, banks and financial institutions are required to send over a variety of suspicious activity reports to the federal government after detecting potential money laundering or terrorist financing. The goal for CI-FIRST is to help financial institutions more easily detect and report financial crimes tied to fentanyl trafficking, drug trafficking, human smuggling and other crimes — by streamlining subpoena requests and improving data-sharing with banks. IRS-CI Chief Guy Ficco said in a statement that “public-private partnerships thrive when everyone mutually benefits.” Also on Friday, IRS Criminal Investigation released new statistics highlighting how the agency has investigated financial crimes using Bank Secrecy Act data. The agency found $21.1 billion in fraud tied to tax and financial crimes from 2022 to 2024, seized $8.2 billion in assets tied to criminal activity in the same period, and recouped $1.4 billion in restitution for crime victims, according to the agency.  “Behind all of these metrics are real crimes with real victims,” said Lauren Kohr, IRS-CI’s strategic engagement adviser. “A lot of times people look at BSA data or the Bank Secrecy Act as a regulatory requirement, but it’s really one of the sharpest tools law enforcement as a whole has to trace fraud illicit money and dismantle these criminal networks.” “And when illicit money moves, it’s these BSA reports,” she said “that tell us the story.” IRS-CI special agents ran an average of 966,900 searches annually against currency transaction reports. A currency transaction report, or CTR, is a financial document that banks are required to file with Treasury for any cash transaction exceeding $10,000 in a single day. In the past three years, roughly 67% of cases opened by IRS-CI involved one or more currency transaction reports below $40,000, with half of currency transaction reports involving amounts less than $22,230. Despite the majority of reports coming in below $40,000, a group of Republican lawmakers is pursing raising the threshold. Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk and nine other House Republicans have sponsored a bill called the Financial Reporting Threshold Modernization Act, which would raise the currency transaction reporting and Suspicious Activity Reporting thresholds to $30,000 and $10,000, respectively, and index the CTR threshold for inflation every five years. On April 1, the House Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutionswill hold a hearingon April 1 and the issue of CTR thresholds will come up. Last December a Government Accountability Office report recommended Treasury help to “reduce the number of CTRs filed that are not used by law enforcement,such as by raising the reporting thresholdor expanding criteria to allow for further exemptions.” In addition to their financial crimes work, IRS Criminal Investigations has been called upon by the Trump administration to help with immigration enforcement. Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noemsent a request to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workersto help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS’s boost in funding, through the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act hasalready been clawed back.

Associated Press reporters in Beirut heard a large boom and witnessedsmoke billowingfrom the area that Israel’s military had vowed to strike.

The strike wounded six other people, the U.S.-based charity said.  In a statement Friday, World Central Kitchen said it would continue to “operate our field kitchens where possible, based on daily assessments.” The statement didn’t give the location of the strike. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.  Last spring, Israel killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza — three British nationals, an Australian, a Polish national, an American-Canadian dual citizen and a Palestinian.  The killings reverberated around the world and prompted multiple charities to suspend food deliveries to Gaza. Since the beginning of this month, Israel has again been blocking all food and other aid from entering Gaza.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his military’s strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut marked an “example” of Israel’s “determination” to act against its northern neighbor.  “We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a trickle,” Netanyahu said in a statement Friday. “We will continue to vigorously enforce the ceasefire, we will attack everywhere in Lebanon, against any threat to the State of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely.”   French President Emmanuel Macron, right, and Lebanese President Joseph Aoun arrive for a joint press conference at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Friday, March 28, 2025. (Sarah Meyssonnier/Pool via AP)   Israel’s military says rocket fire from Lebanon targeted Israel earlier in the day, prompting the military to flatten a building in Beirut which it said was a Hezbollah drone storage site. Hezbollah denied firing rockets into Israel.    The Israeli defense minister threatened to keep striking Lebanon following his country’s first strike in Beirut since the ceasefire with Hezbollah late last year.  Israel Katz said that without peace in the northern Israeli region near Lebanon, called the Galilee, “there will be no peace in Beirut. For any attempt to harm the Galilee communities, the roofs of the houses in the Dahiyeh district of Beirut will shake.”  Israel struck Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, Friday afternoon, saying it had targeted a Hezbollah drone storage facility. It came after Israel said rockets from Lebanon crossed into Israel earlier in the day.  “I am sending a clear message from here to the Lebanese government: If you do not enforce the ceasefire agreement we will enforce it,” said Katz.    Palestinian shepherds were attacked by Israeli settlers in the south of the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, according to Palestinian paramedics and the head of the Palestinian governing body in the area.  One 70-year old man was sent to the hospital because of the attacks and videos from the scene showed at least two Palestinian men lying on the ground, their faces covered with lacerations.  The episode in Jinba follows a nearby settler attack earlier this week that bloodied aPalestinian Oscar-winning co-director, and comes amid a surge of reported attacks in the area of the West Bank known as Masafer Yatta.  Palestinian paramedics said five Palestinians were injured in the attack.   Residents stand in the street for safety after an Israeli army airstrike hit the nearby neighbourhood of Hadath, in Beirut, Friday March 28, 2025.(AP Photo/Hussein Malla)       Nidal Younis, the head of the Masafer Yatta village council, witnessed part of the attack and was detained for two hours shortly after by police. Following his release, he said “dozens of settlers came with Jeeps, ATVs, and some on foot,” descending on the village and attacking residents, including two elderly shepherds.  Younis said Israel’s military prevented Palestinians from nearby villages from helping and threw stun grenades at homes, a claim to which the military did not immediately respond.  Israeli police said they had detained 22 Palestinians from the village on suspicion of stone throwing and injuring two settler shepherds, who they said were minorly injured and evacuated by Israeli paramedics.    Masafer Yatta was designated by the Israeli military as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s, and the military has ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.  Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usuallyturn a blind eyeor intervene on behalf of the settlers.  The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians anddisplaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.    Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun has condemned the Israeli airstrike on Beirut’s southern suburb and any attempt to “bring back the circle of violence” to the small nation.  Speaking during a news conference in Paris, Aoun said Lebanese army is investigating who fired the rockets and “we will not allow anyone to use Lebanon as a launching pad.”  “I call on Lebanon’s friends to act quickly to stop the deterioration and help Lebanon implement international resolutions,” Aoun said.  Speaking alongside Aoun, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to withdraw from five posts it is holding inside Lebanon.    French president Emmanuel Macron condemned Friday what he called “unacceptable strikes on Beirut” after Israel launched an attack on the Lebanese capital for the first time since a ceasefire ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November.  Speaking at a joint press conference alongside Lebanon president Joseph Aoun, Macron said the renewed tensions “mark a turning point.”  “Today’s strikes and the failure to respect the ceasefire are unilateral actions that betray a given promise and play into Hezbollah’s hands,” he said.  He said he will speak with U.S. President Donald Trump and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming hours over the situation in Lebanon.  He added that France will continue to be at Lebanon’s side to help it preserve its sovereignty and guarantee its security.  “This is what we want to do alongside you in the south. This is also what we want to do on the border with Syria, where the situation is also extremely delicate,” Macron said.    Lebanon’s Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a southern Lebanese village has killed three and wounded 18 others.  The ministry added that those wounded in the airstrike on the village of Kfar Tibnit earlier Friday included six children and eight women.  The strike came hours after Israel said two rockets were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group denied it fired the rockets.    The Israeli military confirmed striking a Hezbollah drone storage site in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut.  The military said it carried out the strike after rockets were fired at Israel from Lebanon earlier in the morning in “blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.” It pledged to continue operations “in order to remove any threat to the civilians of the State of Israel.”  Chaos engulfed the southern suburbs of Beirut as Lebanese tried to flee the area, and a large smoke cloud rose over the city following the strike.    Tens of thousands of Muslims gathered at the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem for Ramadan prayers, marking the last Friday observance of a holiday which has passed tensely but without the violence of years past in the contested capital.  The Islamic Trust, which oversees the site, said that 75,000 worshippers gathered, kneeling before the golden Dome of the Rock on the sprawling mosque compound.  Israeli police said they deployed thousands of officers across the city to maintain order and pledged to continue operations.  The Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha is set to begin within the coming days. Palestinian Muslim worshippers pray during Laylat Al Qadr, also known as the Night of Power and marked on the 27th day of the holy fasting month of Ramadan, in front of the Dome of the Rock shrine at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem, Wednesday, March 26, 2025.

The latest naval drills, called theMultilateral Maritime Cooperative Activity, were opened for the first time to a small group of Manila-based media, including an Associated Press photojournalist, since such high-seas maneuvers and joint naval sails began last year. During the daylong maneuvers, the BRP Jose Rizal, a U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer, the DDG Shoup, and a Japanese multi-mission frigate, the JS Noshiro, sailed in formation and communicated by radio. U.S. and Philippine helicopters flew around. A small group of American sailors from the DDG Shoup used a speedboat to transfer to the BRP Jose Rizal and hold discussions with Filipino counterparts. “We are here to support our allies and support a free and open Indo-Pacific for everyone,” U.S. Navy Lt. Alexander Horvath told the AP.  Such naval drills result in “the vital improvements in our coordination, tactics and shared maritime awareness,” Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said in a statement. “Every iteration strengthens our capacity to respond to maritime security challenges while reinforcing our collective ability to safeguard our national interests,” Brawner said. China claimsvirtually the entireSouth China Sea. A 2016 international arbitration ruling invalidated those claims, but Beijing refused to participate in the arbitration,rejected the outcomeand continues to defy it. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the long-seething territorial disputes but confrontations betweenChinese and Philippine coast guardand naval forces have particularly spiked in the last two years. TheUnited States, Japan and the Philippineshave been strengthening a security alliance and pressing efforts to bolster deterrence against China’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, a key global trade route. The trilateral security bloc emerged during the previous Biden administration. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth,who visited Manila on Fridayfor talks with his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said such security blocs should be strengthened to boost deterrence against Chinese aggression in the disputed sea. After the Philippines, Hegseth would travel next to Japan, another staunch U.S. treaty ally. “All three countries are sailing together right now in the region…sending those signals of cooperation,” Hegseth said. “The broader our alliance, the better. The more security cooperation, the better…the more strategic dilemmas for our adversaries, the better.” Associated Press journalist Jim Gomez contributed to this report.

"A bill banning DEI in Ohio public colleges is opposed by students, teachers",https://apnews.com/article/higher-education-ohio-dei-restrictions-faculty-strikes-8b0ab7db08eb712e3350bb241b610f70,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine speaks during a news conference, Dec. 29, 2023, in Columbus, Ohio. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Students, teachers and civil rights groups are calling on Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to veto legislation that wouldban diversity, equity and inclusion programsand make other sweeping changes to public colleges and universities in the state. The bill arrived on DeWine’s desk Wednesday, according to a spokesperson, giving him 10 days excepting Sundays to either sign it, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature. The American Historical Association, American Civil Liberties Union, K-12 unions and Democrats all are calling on the Republican governor to rejectSenate Bill 1, which also would prohibit faculty strikes and limit classroom discussion. DeWine has said that he plans to sign the measure, which sparked hourslong hearings and protests attended by hundreds of demonstrators. The measure was a priority of the GOP-supermajority Legislature, where an amendedSenate-passed versioncleared the Ohio House 59-34 last week and a final version cleared the Ohio Senate 20-11 on Wednesday. Besides banning DEI programs and rescinding certain collective bargaining and tenure protections for faculty, the bill also would make schools promise not to influence student views on “controversial” topics, require every Ohio college student to take a three-hour civics education course and impose dozens of other programmatic and administrative changes. Schools that violated its provisions would risk losing their state funding. The bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Jerry Cirino, a Cleveland-area Republican, has said the bill aims to protect “intellectual diversity,” not dampen it. During Senate debate on the bill in February, Cirino called DEI a “debacle” that “has morphed into institutional discrimination” against conservative perspectives.  Republican President Donald Trump has made the same argument as he has taken aim at DEI programs at the federal level, to the relief and delight of many conservatives. A group of federal employees targeted for dismissal because of their involvement in such activities hasfiled a class-action complaintagainst the administration. And on Thursday, a federal judgetemporarily blockedanother of the president’s DEI-related executive orders affecting federal contractors and grant recipients. ACLU of Ohio Policy Director Jocelyn Rosnick said the bill “sends a clear, harmful message to students that their unique backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are not welcome in Ohio.” “Further, the exceedingly vague and contradictory language regarding the banning of so-called ‘controversial beliefs or policies’ creates a slippery slope for faculty and administration,” she said in a statement. “This could lead to faculty avoiding any such topics in classrooms for fear of retaliation.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Let’s Go Compost via AP)                 NEW YORK (AP) — Lauren Click founded a nonprofit a few years ago offering freecomposting educationto schools around the country. Today, 112 schools participate, yet she can’t get her boyfriend to properly separate his trash at home in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Adults have moreset behaviors than young kids.I try to model a behavior and hopefully he does it,” said Click, executive director of her Let’s Go Compost organization. “But it’s also like, I’m not his parent. I’m not going to berate him every day or ruin my relationship over this. I just fish a bunch of stuff out of the trash.” Her efforts, which she calls 50-50 effective with her partner, point to an important question in the field of environmental psychology: What’sthe best approachwhen looking toinfluence colleagues, friends and family to live more sustainably? What’s the worst? Researchers say Click is on the right track. Modeling can work, though as with other approaches, it depends on who the sender is, how the message is framed and who it’s intended for. Here’s a look at some of the issues and strategies involved in making people more aware of their role inclimate change, which is caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline, coal and gas, and encouraging them to cut waste and protect the natural world.  Magnus Bergquist is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. His research focuses on how to persuade people to adopt more eco-friendly behavior. In a recent study reviewing studies in his area, Bergquist homed in on the influence of others. “What we found was the most effective strategy for changing behavior is social norms, pointing to what other people are doing or people’s perception of other people’s approval or disapproval,” he said. “But interestingly, when we ask people about the effectiveness of different interventions, people tend to say that social norms are among the least effective ones,” Bergquist added. The bottom line: Humans are generally social animals, which isn’t a surprise. But most people underestimate how much they’re influenced by social norms, and campaigns are often based on strategies that are less effective, he said. While Click is unlikely to pay off her boyfriend to do better, Bergquist saidfinancial incentivesor disincentives are the second most effective strategy (behind social norms) in getting people to take more sustainable steps in their lives. That covers everything from bonus cash in a community or office totax benefits, he said. But there’s a caveat. When people change their behavior because of financial incentives or disincentives, “some studies show that it crowds out people’s moral compass,” he said. “They will do it for the money. They won’t do it for the sake of the question as such.” Example: A popular way to promote pro-environmental behavior is holding a contest for something like conserving energy or riding your bike to work. “Ride your bike and a get a prize,” Bergquist explained. “What we see over and over again is that’s effective in the short term. When the prize or the contest is removed, people tend to go back.” Norah Hippolyte is the business manager for St. Mary Magdalen Parish in socially progressive Berkeley, California. She supplies table goods for workers and a wide range of group gatherings, from funerals and community dinners to functions for the parish’s school. For several years, she’s been trying to wean everyone ontocompostable plates, cups, bowls and utensils. “So I buy the stuff. I make sure people are aware I’ve got it in the closet, that that’s where I keep everything. I say, use this stuff. Make sure you let me know when people start to run low,” she said. “But people choose not to use what’s there. They’re using their own things, and it’s all regular plastic.” She tries to get them to rinse and recycle, or clean what’s cleanable so it can be used again. “When I started working in Berkeley, I figured everybody had this whole recycle thing down. Nooooo,” Hippolyte said. “Not only did I have to learn, I have to now try and teach people, OK, this bin is for this, this and this. That bin is for this. Sorting is the biggest issue.” Hippolyte’s experience doesn’t surprise Bergquist. “I always want to mention education — trying to inform people or educate people about issues — because that tends to be ineffective alone,” he said. Bergquist says those who have been talking themselves to death or shoveling facts into the faces of reluctant folks should add some other motivation. For example, when Sarah Davies was trying to convince her 16-year-old son to give up single-use plastics, she switched strategies. “He truly believed he canuse plastic as much as he likesand then put it into the recycling bin,” said Davies, who heads up communications for Earthday.org, organizers of the April 22Earth Day. “What finally made the difference was me explaining that when he’s drinking from a single-use plastic bottle, be it water or soda, he’s also drinking potentially 240,000 nanoparticles of plastics. That shocked him.” Bergquist noted that a couple of experiments have indicated that people pay more attention to negative information than positive information. “So instead of saying many people are pro-environmental, you can say people are avoiding environmentally harmful products,” he said. “It’s the avoidance.” It’s a small but potentially valuable tweak, Bergquist said. Take straws. “Instead of saying people are using paper straws, you might say most people areavoiding plastic straws. You don’t have to explain. People will find an explanation,” he said. Other expert tips for persuasion include picking your battles; starting small, focusing on one habit; appealing to the person’s interest in other benefits, like saving money or being more efficient; keeping it easy; and not forcing the issue.

(Dan Kitwood/Pool Photo via AP)          LONDON (AP) — A badly damaged cargo ship which collided with a U.S. tanker in the North Sea earlier this month arrived in the Scottish port of Aberdeen Friday, following a fire that lasted for nearly a week. Following a tug-assisted journey that lasted a few days, the Portugal-flagged Solong docked in Aberdeen for “safe berthing” and damage assessment. The damage to the ship following itscollision on March 10with an anchored tanker, the MV Stena Immaculate, and the ensuing fire, was clearly visible from the shore. The tanker wastransporting jet fuel for the U.S. militaryin the North Sea. “Salvage of the Solong has progressed to enable its relocation to the Port of Aberdeen for safe berthing,” said chief coastguard Paddy O’Callaghan. “The Stena Immaculate remains in a stable condition with salvage ongoing.” A spokesperson for Ernt Russ, the company which owns the Solong, said the fire-stricken ship will be “fully assessed by specialist marine assessors and insurers” in Aberdeen. The Solong’s Russian captain, Vladimir Motin, has been remanded in custody over the death of a crew member, 38-year-old Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia., who is missing and presumed dead. Motin, 59, has been charged with “gross negligence manslaughter” and is due to appear at the Central Criminal Court in London, better known as the Old Bailey, on April 14. Rescuers saved 36 people from both ships.  U.K. authorities have said there is nothing to indicate the collision was connected to national security, but investigations are ongoing. Fortunately, the environmental damage from the collision was far less than first thought, though thousands of pellets used in plastics production, known as nurdles, from the ruptured containers on the Solong have begun washing up on beaches in the east of England. According to conservationists, the nurdles are not toxic but can harm animals if ingested. Local authorities are working to remove the nurdles.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The fate of addiction treatment hangs in the balance with Kennedy’s HHS overhaul,https://apnews.com/article/hhs-addiction-mental-health-rfk-samsha-e83db20b4ef801971cd25d07eb41bcf9,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A box containing free doses of naloxone, a nasal spray medication to reverse drug overdoses, is installed at Ontario Beach Park in Rochester, N.Y., on Monday, Sept. 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) A little-known federal agency that touches the lives of people across the United States by funding the 988 crisis line, naloxone distribution and addiction treatment may be weakened and possibly eliminated in theproposed overhaulof the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. InHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‘s plan, the $8 billion Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, would be absorbed into a new office, where its more than 700 staffers would co-exist with employees from other agencies responsible for chemical exposures and work-related injuries. In all, five agencies are to be swallowed up under what will be called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, echoing Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again slogan. Merging SAMHSA into a larger agency “will increase operational efficiency and assure programs are carried out because it will break down artificial divisions between similar programs,” according to an HHS news release. “Millions of Americans who get mental health and substance use services depend on SAMHSA even if they have never heard the name of the agency,” said Brendan Saloner, an addiction researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. During Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, he said he was addicted to heroin for 14 years and has been in recovery for 42 years. He called medication-assisted treatment such as Suboxone (buprenorphine) and methadone medically necessary — but also said he considers the gold standard to be 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. During his presidential campaign, Kennedy had proposed a network of “healing farms” where people could work while recovering from addiction.  SAMHSA was created by Congress in 1992, so closing it is illegal and raises questions about Kennedy’s commitment to treating addiction and mental health, said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University addiction researcher. “Burying the agency in an administrative blob with no clear purpose is not the way to highlight the problem or coordinate a response,” Humphreys said. Other experts said crippling SAMSHA could stallprogress on overdose deaths.The agency regulates methadone clinics and pays for addiction prevention efforts in all 50 states. “There’s a reason why we have reduced overdose in this country, it’s because SAMHSA has been doing its job so well,” said Dr. Ruth Potee, medical director for seven methadone clinics in Massachusetts. “My jaw drops at this news.” Noting the24% decline in drug overdose deathsover a recent 12-month period, former White House drug czar Dr. Rahul Gupta said he’s concerned the bureaucratic overhaul will slow momentum. “A worsening overdose crisis is the last thing our nation needs,” said Gupta, who served under President Joe Biden. The announcement followsweeks of dismissals and grant terminationsthat have created an atmosphere of shock and fear among government-funded researchers and federal health employees. Saloner said overhauling a large organization could be done in a way that leads to better services for people, “but I am troubled by the lack of a deliberative process that seems to be creating chaos and driving really talented people out of the federal workforce.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)                                  DA NANG, Vietnam (AP) — Bui Van Phong faced a choice when the Vietnam War ended 50 years ago: Stay in his small village, helping his parents carry on the family’s centuries-old tradition of making fish sauce, or join the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing his country for a better life.  Phong chose to stay behind and nurtured a business making the beloved condiment, known as nuoc mam in Vietnam, that is now in its fourth generation with his son, Bui Van Phu, 41, at the helm. Fish sauce from the village has been recognized by Vietnam as an indelible part of the country’s heritage and the younger Bui is acutely aware of what that means.  “It isn’t just the quality of fish sauce. It is also the historical value,” he said.  But that heritage is under threat, and not only from giant conglomerates that mass-produce fish sauce in factories. Climate change and overfishing are making it harder to catch the anchovies essential to the condiment that underlies so much of Vietnam and southeast Asia’s food.  Anchovies thrive in large schools in nutrient-rich waters near the shore. But climate change is warming the oceans, depleting oxygen levels in the water. Scientists have long feared that this would lead to smaller fish, as large fish that need more oxygen may migrate or adapt over time by shrinking. Renato Salvatteci, who studies fisheries at the Christian-Albrecht University of Kiel in Germany, said his research into warmer periods millenia ago found support for this in the fossil record.  “If we continue with this trend of deoxygenation, anchovies will not be OK with that,” he said. “Every species has a limit.”   Breaching that limit will have global consequences. Fishers retrieve a net on Nguyen Tat Thanh beach on March, 6, 2025, in Da Nang, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   Warming oceans threaten the ocean ecology and the marine life that inhabits it. It may result in the proliferation of smaller, less nutritious fish and increase costs of fishing and consequently food. Anchovies, for instance, have an outsized role on marine ecology. They’re food for other fish that people eat, like mackerel. They are also vital to make fish meal, used to feed farmed fish.  Overfishing compounds the problem, and geopolitical tensions in the contested waters of the South China Sea — responsible for about 12% of the global fish catch — make management difficult. The destructive industrial fishing practice of dragging large nets along the seabed, scooping up everything in a net’s path, has prevailed since the 1980s. But despite increased fishing, the amount of fish being caught has stagnated, according to a2020 analysis of fishing trends.  Even if the world can limit long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels and halve fishing intensity, the South China Sea will still lose more than a fifth of its fish stocks, warned a 2021assessmentby scientists from the University of British Columbia in Canada. In the most pessimistic scenario — temperatures rising by 7.7 degrees Fahrenheit (4.3 degrees) — nearly all the fish disappear.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   Phu, who teaches information technology by day, also works hard to perfect the fish sauce art handed down by his ancestors.  The anchovies are usually caught between January to March when they congregate off the coast of Da Nang. If they are the right species and size, they get mixed gently with sea salt and put in special tera cotta barrels. Sometimes worms or other ingredients are added to bring in different flavors. Phu ferments this for up to 18 months — stirring the mix several times a week — before it can be strained, bottled and sold to customers.  The sea salt imparts different flavor depending on where it comes from. So does the amount of salt used, and makers have their own recipes; the Bui family uses three parts fish to one part salt. The time allowed for fermentation, and the potential addition of other fish, also affect the flavor of the final product.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)  Worms crawl in the fish sauce made in Nam O fishing village, on March 5, 2025, in Da Nang, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   But it is harder to get the perfect anchovies. The fish catch has decreased — fishermen in markets across Vietnam rue the fact that much of the fish they sell now was considered bait-size in previous decades — and it’s only the good relationships he has with anchovy fishermen that allow him to get the fish directly, avoiding high market prices. The unmistakeable aroma of fermenting fish cloaks the homes of families that still make traditional fish sauce. But Phu said that many families are thinking of getting out of the business because of high anchovy prices.  That may affect Vietnamese plans for a bigger share of the global fish sauce market — projected to increase in value from $18.5 billion in 2023 to nearly $29 billion by 2032, according to a report by Introspective Market Research. Vietnam, along with Thailand, is the world’s largest exporter of fish sauce and is hoping improvements in food safety to satisfy standards in lucrative markets like the U.S., Europe and Japan will help cement a national brand that helps advertise Vietnamese culture to the world.  It’s hard to overemphasize how deeply the condiment is enmeshed in Vietnamese culture. Students living abroad speak of how its taste transports them back home and a top chef says it’s the foundation for flavor in the country’s cuisine. The varying taste of different brews also means everyone — from top businessmen to daily wage workers — has their own opinions about which is the best.  Phu said that each family has their own secrets about making fish sauce. And, nearly fifty years since his father chose to stay back and take care of the family business, he’d like to pass those on to his own son. But he knows that it’ll depend on whether enough anchovies thrive in the sea for the craft to be viable.  “Fish sauce to me is not just a condiment for cooking. But it is our craft, our culture, our tradition that need to be preserved, safeguarded and inherited,” he said.

In this combination image released by ESA/Webb, left, an enhanced-color image of Neptune from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and right, that image is combined with data from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. (ESA/Webb via AP) WASHINGTON (AP) —Neptune’sglowing auroras are captured in the best detail yet byNASA’s James WebbSpace Telescope. Hints of auroras were first faintly detected in ultraviolet light during a flyby of the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. Webb captured Neptune’s shimmering lights in infrared light, providing direct evidence they exist. NASA released the images on Wednesday, and the results were published in the journalNature Astronomy. Auroras on any planet occur when electrically charged particles from space enter and collide with molecules in the atmosphere, creating a series of reactions that emits light. On Earth, auroras tend to occur near the polar regions, producing spectacular northern and southern lights. Scientists have studied auroras on Saturn and Jupiter for decades, but Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, has been harder to see up close. “Neptune has always been elusive,” said University of Reading planetary scientist James O’Donoghue, co-author of the new study. Its auroras “had only been seen by Voyager, and we’ve been trying to see it again ever since.” Neptune’s auroras occur near the mid-latitudes of the planet, not the polar regions, because of differences in its magnetic field, which determine the span of auroras, said O’Donoghue. More than three decades after Voyager 2’s pass, scientists have seen Neptune’s auroras again with the powerful Webb telescope, producing “the first robust detection,” co-author Heidi Hammel of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, said in an email. The researchers also revealed that Neptune’s atmosphere has cooled significantly since the 1980s, which may have somewhat dimmed the light of the auroras.

Travers, Feb. 10, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)     NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”targets the Smithsonian Institution— which has, he contends, “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” Critics have pushed back, saying the order is an attempt to whitewash American history. His order is part of a wave of actions against cultural organizations that he alleges have been overtaken by “woke” ideology,from the Kennedy Centerto theInstitute of Museum and Library Services. The Voice of America and PBS are also in his sights. Trump has tasked Vice President JD Vance to lead the effort to “effectuate the policies” of the executive order, including to ensure no funding goes to “exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.” Here’s a look at the Smithsonian Institution and what’s going on with it. With an annual budget exceeding $1 billion, the Smithsonian is the “world’s largest museum, education, and research complex,” according to its website. It was conceived in the 19th century by the British scientist, James Smithson, who bequeathed his estate for the purpose of a Washington-based establishment that helps with “the increase and diffusion of knowledge.” In 1846, 17 years after Smithson’s death, President James K. Polk signed legislation calling for the Institution’s formation.  The Smithsonian now operates a broad range of cultural centers in Washington and beyond, including the Air and Space Museum, the Portrait Gallery, the National Zoo and the Smithsonian Gardens. Around 60% of its funding is from the federal government, but the Institution also receives money from “trust funds or non-federal funds, which include contributions from private sources,” according to its website. In his executive order, he made the claim that “the National Museum of African American History and Culture has proclaimed that ‘hard work,’ ‘individualism,’ and ‘the nuclear family’ are aspects of ‘White culture’” and criticized an upcoming exhibit at the American Women’s History Museum that highlights the achievements of trans athletes. He also singled out an exhibit at the American Art Museum that “promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct.” In 2017, Trump visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture with then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Alveda King, a niece of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The president’s tour was guided by Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian Institution’s current secretary and founding director of NMAAHC. The museum includes an exhibit highlighting the career achievements of Carson, a successful pediatric neurosurgeon who has long been celebrated as a role model to Black aspiring medical doctors. “I’m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,” Trump said following the 2017 tour. “I know President (Barack) Obama was here for the museum’s opening last fall. And I’m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.” Outside the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Friday, Trump’s executive order and its potential impact were met with dismay. Dorothy Wilson, visiting for the first time with her two grandchildren, said she was very concerned about what it would mean for them and others if they weren’t able to learn the truth about the past. “It really hurts generations because your history is who you are,” she said. Elizabeth Pagano, coming from New York state’s Hudson Valley, said: “The history of the United States, and the history of everybody that came through, is everybody’s history. You can’t pick and choose your history.” In a statement, Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said, “Black history is U.S. history. Women’s history is U.S. history. This country’s history is ugly and beautiful. And each historic struggle for civil rights has advanced our movement toward a truly inclusive, multiracial democracy.” Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela in New York and videojournalist Mike Pesoli in Washington contributed to this report.

"A new Chili’s near Scranton will be a throwback to ‘The Office,’ ‘awesome blossom’ and all",https://apnews.com/article/office-chilis-scranton-2faea0e7841dcd6903a798064fd17508,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Chili’s is opening a new restaurant just north of Scranton to honor the legacy of the show, “The Office.” The new Chili’s will have a mid-2000s theme and will bring back the “awesome blossom,” an onion dish celebrated on the show but long discontinued by the chain. It has been nearly two decades since the workplace mockumentary“The Office”first set an episode inside a Chili’s, where Michael Scott handed out Dundie awards to his ever-tolerant employees, including trophies for the whitest sneakers and for stinking up the bathroom. Over nine seasons, “The Office” regularly name-dropped real places and products associated with Scranton, where the Emmy-winning show was set. There’s the big pirate ship restaurant known as Cooper’s Seafood House and Poor Richard’s Pub inside a bowling alley. But in 2005, there was no Chili’s in the Pennsylvania city. So, at last, the chain is filling a hole in Office lore by opening a Chili’s in Dickson City, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) north of Scranton. This undated photo provided by Chili’s, shows actors Brian Baumgartner, left, who played Kevin Malone, and Kate Flannery, who played Meredith Palmer in the TV series “The Office,” posing in a soon-to-be opened Chili’s in Dickson City, Pa. (Ben Rosenzweig, Chili’s via AP)  The restaurant will be decorated as it would have been in the mid-2000s with old signs and chalkboard art. It will also feature direct nods to the show’s fictitious paper company, Dunder Mifflin. In one episode, Scott, played by Steve Carell, orders an awesome blossom — a deep-fried onion with a cheese dipping sauce — while trying to win a new client over lunch at Chili’s. That item, long struck from the Chili’s menu nationwide, is being reintroduced in the Scranton-area restaurant only. The new Chili’s will open April 7, when a “Scranton marg” will be available nationwide for the day. Two Office actors are appearing in commercials for the restaurant: Brian Baumgartner, who played the dimwitted accountant Kevin Malone; and Kate Flannery, whose character Meredith Palmer was a party-loving divorced mother working in supplier relations. Other actors, including Melora Hardin, Andy Buckley and Amy Pietz, also feature in a promotional video. “It seems like a wrong was righted here at around the 20th anniversary of the show to finally have a Scranton branch of Chili’s,” Baumgartner told The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Decades ago, when word got out that an American version of the British show “The Office” would center on Scranton, some locals feared their hometown would be the butt of the joke. The Rust Belt town had its heyday generations earlier with anthracite coal mining and steam trains. The show wound up celebrating Scranton and the characters, not poking fun at them, Baumgartner said. A life-sized Dundie Award is displayed in Scranton City Hall’s entryway, Tuesday, March 25, 2025, in Scranton, Pa. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Flannery, who is from Philadelphia, said she’s happy “The Office” helped to reinforce local pride in the city. Scranton has hostedlarge Office parties, including one that drew many cast members and some 10,000 people around the 2013 series finale. Streaming services have boosted the show’s popularity. “It’s kind of like what Pam Beesly says in the last episode: there’s beauty in ordinary things. And Scranton can feel ordinary to some people,” Flannery told the AP. “But it’s really special. It really is.” The show banked on residents and businesses to donate Scranton swag, and gave shout-outs to local landmarks. John Krasinski, who played Jim Halpert, filmed scenes for the opening montage in Scranton, making the city’s Penn Paper tower recognizable around the world. The “Scranton welcomes you” sign from Krasinski’s footage was moved to a downtown mall because people kept stopping on a highway to take photos. This undated image released by Chili’s shows actors Andy Buckley, from left, Melora Hardin and Amy Pietz, who appeared in the TV series “The Office,” posing at a soon-to-be opened Chili’s in Dickson City, Pa. (Chili’s via AP)  For Chili’s, building a themed eatery that is expected to draw tourists isn’t the normal course of business, said George Felix, Chili’s chief marketing officer. In 2005, the nearest Chili’s was about 19 miles (30 kilometers) away from Scranton. It has since closed. “Given the ties that this brand has to Scranton, this one was definitely special for us,” Felix told the AP. Baumgartner, who analyzed the show in a podcast and book, said the new Chili’s calls back to a crucial episode — The Dundies — that kicked off Season 2, Baumgartner said. “We were a failing show, quite frankly, with really bad ratings that first season and barely got brought back for a second,” Baumgartner said. “But some tonal things were changed. We decided to open that second season with kind of a bang, and left the office for the first time.” In that episode, Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, won the “whitest sneakers” Dundie and declared tipsily, “I feel God in this Chili’s tonight.” Pam was subsequently banned from Chili’s nationwide for stealing people’s drinks. In 2017, Chili’s pardoned the character, saying she was welcome back. “It’s going to feel like they’re actually on the show because it’s going to look exactly the same,” Flannery said of the Scranton-area Chili’s. “So it’s like a fan destination. It’s kind of awesome.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Photo by Alberto Pezzali/Invision/AP)          NEW YORK (AP) — It wasn’tthe night punk broke,but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, theSex Pistols— then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock — performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash. The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights. Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols — Jones, Cook and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) — sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. “This is where it all kicked off, really,all the punk,”says Cook. This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined byJohn Lydon (formerly Rotten.)The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas — the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978. Jones recalls having “pigs’ hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.” It is one of a few dates featured in three “Live in the U.S.A.” albums, documenting the band’s ’78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.  “We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,” Jones jokes. The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 atthe Hollywood Palladiumin Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later. Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3.Tickets go on saleApril 4 at 10 a.m. local time. They will perform the band’s sole album, 1977’s “Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols Album” live in its entirety as well as other material. So, why tour the U.S. andCanadanow? “Why not?” says Jones. “I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,” says Carter. “And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.” “At the end of the day, we’re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,” he continued. “Punk is an energetic music. It’s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs’ hooves.” Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour. “The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,” says Jones, referring toa previous lawsuitbetween the singer and the band over music use intheir TV series “Pistol.”The judge ruled against Lydon’s opposition. “We wish him the best,” Jones said. “Good luck to him,” adds Matlock. “I wish he thinks, maybe, ‘good luck’ to us. Probably doesn’t. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can’t see many missed calls from him.” As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn’t expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance. “We’re a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,” says Matlock. “And I think that’s something that’s got a great deal of aplomb that we’re going to bring to the public over there.” Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? “It’s early days,” says Jones. “Let’s see what happens.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Cameron County Constable PCT 5 via AP)       ALAMO, Texas (AP) — South Texas worked to dry out on Friday after severe thunderstorms a day earlier flooded streets, forced the closure of an airport and compelled dozens of water rescues as many drivers were forced to abandon their vehicles on roads and parking lots as some areas were inundated with more than a foot of rain. “We’re just getting like a bucket of water poured on us and it’s too much for the drainage system,” Alamo Fire Department Chief R.C. Florestold KRGVin Weslaco, Texas. “A lot of these are stranded motorists with no immediate danger, but we do want to make sure we are prioritizing the medical calls first.” Flores said Alamo’s fire and police departments had responded to more than 50 water rescues on Thursday. Weslaco Mayor Adrian Gonzalez said his city was inundated with about 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain, prompting 30 to 40 water rescues of stranded motorists and residents trapped in their homes by rising floodwaters. “It’s a historic rainstorm and it’s affecting all the Valley, not just Weslaco. It’s just so much water in a short period of time,” Gonzalez told reporters at a news conference. Television news footage from flooded communities in South Texas showed multiple waterlogged cars abandoned on streets on Thursday and drivers waiting on sidewalks for the floodwaters to recede. Between 6 inches (15 centimeters) and 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of South Texas in the past 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service. Palmview, located west of McAllen, received more than 18 inches (45 centimeters) of rain over the past two days.  In neighboring Cameron County, officials asked Gov. Greg Abbott to declare a disaster for the county after more than 17 inches of rain caused significant flooding. “The rainfall amounts we received have been record-setting, and not in a good way. All county resources are being utilized right now, and we are assisting in all ways possible,” Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, Jr., the county’s top elected official, said in a Facebook post. Valley International Airport in Harlingen was closed on Friday and all flights were canceled due to area flooding. “We are working tirelessly to reopen and focused on ensuring safety,” airport officials said in a statement. More than 3,700 in several counties in South Texas remained without power on Friday afternoon, according to AEP Texas. A flood warning was still in effect for portions of South Texas, including Cameron, Hidalgo and Willacy counties, through early Friday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. “There’s a break from the rain this morning, which will allow flood waters to gradually recede, but we’ll still need to keep an eye on the development of isolated showers and thunderstorms once again this afternoon,” the National Weather Service said on social media. “Any additional rainfall will be quick to cause flooding issues given the heavy rainfall that has already fallen.” The Pharr-San Juan-Alamo school district opened two shelter locations on Thursday night for residents. One shelter had been opened in Weslaco. More than 20 South Texas school districts and college campuses canceled classes on Friday due to the severe weather and flooding.

(AP Photo/Thoko Chikondo, File) Elephants drink water in the Chobe National Park in Botswana, March 3, 2013. (AP Photo/Charmaine Noronha/File)       CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Rural farming communities on the border between the southern African countries of Malawi and Zambia are seeking damages and threatening to sue an internationalanimal conservationgroup over therelocation of more than 260 elephantsto their area, which their lawyers say have killed at least 12 people and injured others, destroyed crops and property, and left thousands living in fear. British law firm Leigh Day said it is representing 10 people living near the Kasungu National Park on the Malawi-Zambia border, who say their lives have been ruined by the arrival of the elephants in 2022. The elephants were meant to be contained in the park, but theworld’s largest land animalsrarely respect man-made borders and have broken through fences to raid nearby small-scale farming communities in both countries for food and water, causing death and damage, according to the lawyers. A local non-profit organisation recorded more than 11,000 people who had suffered crop or property damage, personal injury or the death of a family member due to elephants and estimated the damage was millions of dollars, the lawyers said. Some of the community members were struggling to feed their families as a result of their livelihoods being destroyed, the lawyers said. “They say the action placed the wellbeing of the elephants above that of local communities,” Leigh Day said.  Leigh Day said the communities want the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a renowned United States-based conservation charity that was involved in the elephant relocation, to “resolve the harms” they have allegedly suffered. The lawyers sent letters to the IFAW’s business entities in the U.K., Malawi and Zambia, they said, and if there was no engagement they would file a claim against the conservation group in a British court. The IFAW said it was deeply saddened by any human-wildlife conflict in and around Kasungu, but rejected any wrongdoing. The wildlife group said its role in the relocation project was to provide financial and technical support and the government of Malawi through its Department of National Parks and Wildlife “has overall jurisdiction and responsibility for all national parks and wildlife in Malawi.” The relocation was performed by experts from various organizations, the IFAW told The Associated Press in a statement. Malawi’s parks department did not reply to emailed questions on the problems with the elephants in Kasungu. The case reflects the difficulties many African countries are faced with when balancing the need to conserve wildlife with the impact wild animals have on the people who share their habitat.Elephant numbers have increasedin parts of the continent because of decades of successful conservation work, and a new challenge is ensuring the growing numbers are able to co-exist with people. Climate change has meant more competition between humans and animalsfor resources like food and waterand elephants can be especially destructive. Adult elephants can eat 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation and drink 200 liters of water a day and have no problem pulling down trees, destroying fields of crops and boreholes and ransacking stores to get food and water. Some African countriescull elephantsto control their numbers or allow them to be hunted to raise money. They have sometimes been criticized for that, and the issue was best vocalized last year when then-Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi threatened to send 20,000 elephants to Germany in response to its criticism of Botswana’shunting and elephant trophy businesses.Germans should “live together with the animals in the way you are trying to tell us to,” Masisi told the German newspaper Bild. “This is no joke.” The animal relocation project in Malawi in July 2022 was initially seen as a major success by taking 263 elephants from an overpopulated smaller park to Kasungu, where elephant numbers had dwindled years ago because of poaching. It was one of the largest elephant relocation projects undertaken as hundreds of the beasts were darted and hauled onto trucks by crane to be transported while sedated. But the lawyers for people living near Kasungu said the problems were almost immediate and alleged two people were killed days after the elephants arrived. Leigh Day said its clients recognize IFAW as a wildlife charity that aims to have a positive impact on conservation, but they want to “live safely in their communities again.” AP Africa news:https://apnews.com/hub/africa   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved. Health officials prepare to administer a vaccine in the Malawi village of Tomali with the world’s first vaccine against malaria in a pilot program in Tomali, Dec. 11, 2019. (AP Photo/Jerome Delay, File) GENEVA (AP) — The head of leading vaccines group Gavi alliance said Thursday it has not received confirmation from the U.S. government that it might be losing more than $1 billion in pledged funding as part of a reported proposal by U.S. authorities to cut support for international aid groups. According to a leaked 281-page spreadsheet issued by the United States Agency for International Aid this week, the U.S. plans to terminate 5,341 awards to dozens of groups it had previously supported, including theGavi alliance, a global vaccines group that helpsimmunizemore than half the world’s children against infectious diseases. The spreadsheet was first reported by The New York Times. “We have not received a termination notice from the U.S. government,” said Dr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s Chief Executive. In a statement on Thursday, Nishtar said Gavi was “engaging with the White House and Congress,” hoping to secure the $300 million approved by Congress for their activities this year, as well as longer-term funding. Nishtar said that a cut to Gavi’s funding would be “disastrous,” potentially resulting in more than 1 million deaths from preventable diseases. The U.S. had pledged to provide more than $1.5 billion through 2030 to Gavi, founded in 2000 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the World Bank. The Geneva-based group says it has helped vaccinate more than 1 billion children in 78 poorer countries against diseases including measles, Ebola andmalaria, averting nearly 19 million deaths.  Dr. David Elliman, a children’s health expert at University College London, called the reported U.S. withdrawal of funding from Gavi “cruel” and “utterly misguided.” “If diseases such as measles and TB increase anywhere in the world, it is a hazard to us all,” he said. The USAID spreadsheet lists more than 5,341 awards that the U.S. is planning to terminate to groups including UNICEF, the International Societies of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Save the Children, Doctors of the World and Action Against Hunger.

The anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider. More than 150 of the groups signed a letter Wednesday urging Congress to cut Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other health care centers that provide abortions through the budget reconciliation process. “Today is a historic moment where the pro-life movement stands united behind one message: Defund Planned Parenthood,” said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, as she kicked off the rally in view of the U.S. Capitol. She called on Trump and other Republicans to “defund your political enemies,” adding that the abortion lobby has long targeted Republicans. The federal Hyde Amendmentalready restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization’s 2023 annual report. Vicki Ringer, Planned Parenthood’s South Carolina director of public affairs, said claims that Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding for abortion is “an attempt to mislead the public” and emphasized Planned Parenthood’s role in providing broader reproductive health care.  “We should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,” Ringer said. Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of services besides abortion. Its most recent annual report shows that contraceptive services and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections make up the vast majority of its medical care. It also performs more cancer screening and prevention procedures than abortions, according to the report. The national group said eliminating its federal funding could put those services out of reach for millions of people and would hit low-income communities with little access to health care hardest. Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University’s Beasley School of Law, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump’s presidential victory and by Republicans winningcontrol of Congressin November. “We’re seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,” she said. Tina Whittington, executive vice president at Students for Life, said she was confident that Trump would consider cutting Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid funding and that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could be just the tool for doing it. “I’m more confident because we’re in an era where DOGE’s actions are targeting waste, fraud and abuse,” she said. “And this is a great way to do that.” The Supreme Court announced it will hear a case involvingSouth Carolina’s attempt to strip Medicaid fundingfor Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization’s funding. During a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years. Meanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states — Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina — have introduced bills this year aiming to createtax breaks for anti-abortion centers. The strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict access tomedication abortionnationwide. Rather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves afterwaffling on the issueon the campaign trail. He reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don’t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning. He also pardoned several anti-abortion activists who had been convicted of blockading abortion clinics and used wording related tofetal personhoodinan executive orderrolling back protections for transgender people. The Republican president has appointed abortion opponents to some key Cabinet positions that could affect the availability of medication abortion and contraception, Medicaid coverage for family planning services, collection of abortion-related data and abortion access for troops and veterans. In a pre-recorded message to the thousands who attendedthe March for Lifein January, Trump said he proudly stood for families and for life. Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville said during Thursday’s rally that he “truly believes President Trump is the most pro-life president in history.” “Absolutely zero taxpayer dollars should be going to abortion,” he said. “… And I know President Trump agrees.” Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said Republican control of the White House and Congress represents a unique opportunity to push for legislation targeting Planned Parenthood. “I believe this is the moment they will be defunded, and this is the blow that will bring them down,” she said. Advocates on either side of the abortion debate are waiting to see if Trump’s Department of Justice will revivethe Comstock Act, a 19th-century obscenity law, to restrict the mailing of medication abortion or other materials used for abortions. Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of defending abortion restrictions, andher confirmationwas celebrated by abortion opponents. At the Thursday rally, some passers-by shouted support for Planned Parenthood, saying the organization saves lives. Haven Wright, an 83-year-old retired entrepreneur visiting Washington to see the National Museum of African American History and Culture, happened upon the rally and noted that Planned Parenthood also provided health care for underserved communities. “They are the main doctors for many, many poor women,” she said. “They are their main resource for all kinds of reproductive health care.” Wright said she had two abortions while in her 20s, once while she had an IUD and another time after she was raped. She said she was grateful she had the “agency to get the care I needed.” “Women,” she said, “deserve a choice.” Follow the AP’s coverage of abortion athttps://apnews.com/hub/abortion.

Suspected US strikes pummel Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-us-airstrikes-israel-hamas-war-611420fcfcfe5649937e19b6c2a316e8,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The Houthi’s media office said on Friday that new U.S. airstrikes struck several regions of the country including Hodeida, al Jewf and the capital, Sanaa. This is a locator map for Yemen with its capital, Sanaa. (AP Photo) In this image made from video, smoke rises after a blast in Sanaa, Yemen, Friday, March 28, 2025. (AP Photo)      DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Suspected U.S. airstrikes pummeled sites across Yemen controlled by theHouthi rebelsearly Friday, including neighborhoods in the capital, Sanaa. The extent of the damage and possible casualties wasn’t immediately clear, though the number of strikes appeared particularly intense compared to other days in the campaign that began March 15. An Associated Press reviewhas found the new American operation underPresident Donald Trumpappears more more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel as well as dropping bombs in cities. Initial reports from the Houthis described at least seven people being hurt in the attacks Friday in Sanaa, Yemen’s capital that the rebels have held since 2014. Other strikes hit around the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, the rebel’s stronghold of Saada and in Yemen’s al-Jawf, Amran and Marib governorates. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge what at those sites had been targeted, other than Sanaa International Airport, which is used for both civilian and military traffic. Neighborhoods in the capital also are home to military and intelligence service sites — as well as crowded with civilians. An Associated Press video showed one bomb dropping into Sanaa, with a huge plume of smoke rising into the night sky as many people were awake in the final days of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.  Other areas hit included mountainous terrain north of Sanaa in Amran, where military camps and other installations are believed to be. The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news network described communication networks going down after the attacks, which included at least 19 strikes there alone. The U.S. military’s Central Command, which now has authority from the White House to strike offensively in Yemen without pre-approval, did not immediately acknowledge conducting any strikes. The command, which under Biden offered details on individual strikes, has not provided that information in this campaign. The new campaign of airstrikes,which the Houthis say have killed at least 57 people, started afterthe rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” shipsagain over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones,sinking two vesselsand killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far. The attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S. Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemis visiting Mexico on Friday to cap off a tour to three Latin American nations to discuss immigration, crime and deportation. Noem’s first visit to the region comes as the region gains increasing importance to the Trump administration as it attempts to scale up deportation efforts and warn against migration north. As Noem visited El Salvador and Colombia, Secretary of State Marco Rubiovisited Guyanato meet with a number of Caribbean leaders. Noem was slated to meet with Mexican PresidentClaudia Sheinbaumand other top Mexican officials. Sheinbaum’s government has been working to offsettariffs lodged by the Trump administration, which economic forecasters say could thrust the Mexican economy into a recession. In exchange for delaying sanctions in past months, the Mexican government sent 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and reported sharp crackdowns on drug labs. It also sent 29 top cartel figures long sought by the American government to the U.S. to face justice. Despite25% tariffs on auto partsannounced by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this week, Sheinbaum said the focus of her conversation with Noem would largely be about security and migration, adding that she would emphasize Mexico’s sovereignty in the meeting. “More that informing, we’re going to share with her what is being done and also the coordination and collaboration that has been established with the United States,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing. “It is going to be a cordial meeting on coordination.”  While other leaders have taken a more confrontational approach with Trump and imposed reciprocal tariffs, Sheinbaum has walked a fine line with the Republican U.S. president, and the government has taken a collaborative approach to offset the economic blow. On Wednesday, Sheinbaum said Mexico would seek “preferential treatment” to Trump’s auto tariffs. Sheinbaum’s managing of the relationship with Trump has been met by soaring approval in Mexico.

Residue from human waste has long wound up as farm fertilizer. Some neighbors hate it,https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-biosolids-sewage-sludge-pfas-health-27ef39f1561f66548b1cca5ce46062d4,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Opposition to the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer is growing across the country. While the practice has been happening for decades, there are increasing concerns about potential pollution of groundwater from toxic chemicals in wastewater. (AP Video: Joshua A. Bickel) WELLSTON, Okla. (AP) — When Leslie Stewart moved to her home in a rural expanse of Lincoln County outside of Oklahoma City more than 20 years ago, she thought she’d found a slice of heaven. In a town of fewer than 700 people, her son could attend a good school and her acreage offered plenty of room to raise goats and let her dogs run.  But several years ago, her neighbor began applying sewage sludge, which consists largely of human waste left over from municipal wastewater treatment facilities, as a fertilizer on his farmland, causing a rancid smell so powerful it nearly took her breath away.  “The smell is so overwhelming that it goes through my oxygen machine and straight up my nose, which makes it very difficult for me to even walk out my door,” said Stewart, 53, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Bickel)    Leslie Stewart, left, sits inside her living room with her husband, Danny, right, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, in Wellston, Okla. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   In the summer, the sewage sludge, referred to in the industry as biosolids, attracted so many flies there was no way to keep them out of the house.  “They come through the vents. They come through the vent on the stove,” she said. “It’s just absolutely miserable.”  Stories like Stewart’s are common in rural areas across the U.S. And while the application of sewage sludge as a fertilizer on farmland has been happening for decades, opposition is mounting amid growing environmental concerns about potential pollution of groundwater from toxic chemicals in wastewater. One county in Texasdeclared a state of disasterthis year amid reported deaths of fish and cattle, as well as the contamination of groundwater, in areas where sewage sludge was being used as fertilizer. A crew applies sewage sludge to a field, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, in Wellston, Okla. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   Now the battle over how to place guardrails on the practice is playing out in legislatures even in red states like Oklahoma. Maine has temporarily banned the land application of sewage sludge and Oklahoma is considering a similar ban. Many other states are more closely regulating the practice.   One big concern is the human health risk from toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as forever chemicals because they don’t degrade in the environment. They’re linked to health issues such as low birth weight and liver disease along with certain types of cancers. These chemicals, which are found in some nonstick cookware, grease-resistant food packaging, carpet fibers and certain cosmetics, can end up in wastewater and ultimately in the sludge that is used to fertilize farmland.  Farmers typically get the sludge for free, saving them hundreds of dollars per acre over synthetic fertilizer, said Brian Arnall, a professor of plant and soil sciences at Oklahoma State University.  Astudy released this yearby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests human health risks exceeding EPA’s thresholds, sometimes by “several orders of magnitude,” for scenarios where farmers applied the sludge to their land. Another study published last year by theAmerican Chemical Societyfound that PFAs can leak from biosolids into groundwater after a single application.  In Oklahoma, the issue has become so contentious at the state Capitol that a longtime state House member was upset in a GOP primary last year after he acknowledged using sewage sludge during a town hall-style forum and defended the practice as a private property rights issue.   Oklahoma Republican Rep. Jim Shaw, who opposes using sewage sludge as fertilizer, poses for a portrait, Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025, in Oklahoma City. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   Rep. Jim Shaw, the winner of that race, called the issue a major reason for his victory. He’s now seeking to ban the practice statewide.  “I think we’re rapidly approaching an emergency issue in our state and across the nation,” Shaw said. “It is absolutely at the top of my list as needing traction on it immediately.”  The issue is particularly acute in Shaw’s part of the state, where nearby Oklahoma City has an estimated 5,000 acres that have been permitted for land application of its sewage sludge.  Among those who want to keep using sewage sludge as fertilizer are cities and towns across the state who have found it cheaper than other ways of getting rid of the material, like burning it or putting it in landfills. Oklahoma City wastewater officials declined to be interviewed but provided a fact sheet on their use of biosolids that estimated developing an alternative to land application would cost more than $100 million in capital improvements and take as long as 10 years to implement.

(AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   The state’s Department of Environmental Quality has rules that require any biosolids used as fertilizer to meet certain criteria on levels of heavy metals and pathogen reduction requirements, but the agency acknowledged they aren’t currently testing for PFAS.  Several Oklahoma farmers who apply sewage sludge to their property, including Stewart’s neighbor, declined to speak to The Associated Press.  Synagro, the nation’s largest processors of biosolids, said in a statement that all the sewage sludge used by the company and its customers meets federal and state requirements.  “Biosolids provide multiple benefits to overall soil quality and health, including improved moisture absorption ability, recycling of micro and macro nutrients, carbon sequestering, reduced nutrient leaching, and lower use of industrially produced chemical fertilizers,” the company said. “Another key benefit is keeping biosolids out of landfills where they can cause methane emissions that contribute to climate change.” Saundra Traywick pets some of her donkeys, Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2025, at her farm in Luther, Okla.

After getting Luther to ban the practice several years ago, she has taken her crusade to the state Capitol and found herself fighting against cities that want to maintain the status quo.  “They can not have to pay for a landfill or to upgrade their wastewater treatment plants, and instead spend money on art, parks and beautification projects and arenas, and continue to dump this on people outside their districts,” she said. “The injustice of that just blows my mind.” A crew applies biosolids to a field, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, in Wellston, Okla.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear displays his colors in veto fights with Republican lawmakers,https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-governor-andy-beshear-republican-lawmakers-f95dd8c69b4aeae9169f58d5deaa5ba1,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear delivers his State of The Commonwealth address in the House chamber at the State Capitol in Frankfort, Ky., Jan. 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File) FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Knowing the odds of winning were stacked against him, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear nevertheless vetoed bills sent his way by the Republican-dominated Kentucky legislature with by-now familiar themes:abortion, Medicaid anddiversity initiatives. The bills reprised partisan disputes that have become as much a sign of springtime in Kentucky as the tulips blooming at the state Capitol. But they also sent fresh signals to national Democrats about who Beshear is as speculation continues about whether he’ll run for president in 2028. “His veto pen has been consistent,” said Democratic political strategist Mark Riddle. ”It’s been authentic and it’s within his core value set. And that’s a very easy argument to take to the country.” The vetoes, Riddle said, signal “who he will fight for and who he will take on and fight against.” In practical terms, Beshear couldn’t stop Kentucky Republicans from doing what they wanted. In overriding his vetoes with methodical efficiency on Thursday, they followed the same script that’s played outat the end of legislative sessionsthroughout Beshear’s two terms as governor. Still, that didn’t stop him from seizing the moment to shed light on his political beliefs, casting his fights with Republicans in ways that could easily shift toward a more national audience. “By now,” Beshear said in a statement Friday, “Kentuckians know that I’ll always do what I believe is right, and the right thing here was to veto these bills.”  Known for an even-keeled, disciplined style, Beshear’s willingness to push back against Republican supermajorities could bolster his political stock in national Democratic circles. Beshear has won three elections in GOP-dominated Kentucky — once as attorney general and twice as governor. Former Kentucky state Sen. Damon Thayer, a Republican who spent years in Senate leadership, said Beshear’s vetoes show his true colors as a “traditional liberal Democrat.” For years, Thayer made the motions for the Senate to override those vetoes, calling it “one of my favorite parts of the job.” “It’s just been frustrating to me over the years that the voting public that seems so enamored with him hasn’t really paid attention to the fact that he’s vetoed … bills that the majority of Kentuckians support,” Thayer said. That’s not the whole picture. Each year, stacks of bills signed by Beshear far outnumber his vetoes. And despite a rocky relationship with GOP lawmakers, they’ve teamed up on far-reaching legislation in recent years —legalizing medical marijuana and sports bettingand steering federal funding toward such shared priorities as broadband expansion and infrastructure. But veto battles have exposed the friction in Kentucky’s divided government. That included longstanding culture-war issues — abortion, conversion therapy and diversity, equity and inclusion programs — as GOP lawmakers swept aside Beshear vetoes on Thursday. Supporters of the abortion measure said it offered clarity to doctors fearful of violating Kentucky law for terminating pregnancies while treating expectant mothers with grave complications. Amid the state’s near-total abortion ban, the bill offers guidelines for doctors in such emergencies, they said. Beshear said it would have the opposite effect, siding with abortion-rights supporters. The governor said it would undermine the clinical judgment of doctors and put pregnant women at greater risk when faced with medical emergencies. David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a socially conservative group, said the veto exposed Beshear as a “mouthpiece” for abortion-rights groups In rejecting a bill to dismantle DEI efforts at public universities, Beshear cast his veto in terms of his faith. He said diversity should be embraced as a strength and branded the legislation as being “about hate.” “I believe in the Golden Rule that says we love our neighbor as ourself, and there are no exceptions, no asterisks,” said Beshear, a church deacon. “We love and we accept everyone.” Republicans sprung a big change for Medicaid — adding a work requirement for able-bodied adult recipients with no dependents — just ahead of the deadline to retain their override power. Beshear answered with a veto, saying some adults would lose health coverage, and Republicans overrode him. GOP state Sen. Chris McDaniel has said Republicans are committed to supporting vulnerable Kentuckians but added: “This nation demands that those who can put forth effort do.” Beshear also denounced conversion therapy as “torture” in vetoing legislation that safeguards access to the practice. Conversion therapy is the scientifically discredited practice of trying to “convert” LGBTQ+ people to heterosexuality or traditional gender expectations through therapeutic treatment. With their override,Republicans nullified restrictionsBeshear has placed on the practice in an executive order last year. In his veto message, Beshear said policymakers should be protecting kids, not “subjecting them to discredited methods that jeopardize their health, wellbeing and safety.” Associated Press Writer Dylan Lovan in Louisville contributed to this report.

Thai emergency responders also said an unknown number of others were still under the rubble of the building. (AP video/Sakchai Lalit) People waited anxiously outside buildings after a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok collapsed when a 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked Thailand and neighboring Myanmar midday on Friday, police said, and possible casualties are not yet known. Police told The Associated Press they were responding to the scene near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, and had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse. Thailand’s defense minister says at least 90 people are missing and three are confirmed dead at the site where a high-rise building under construction collapsed when a powerful earthquake hit the capital of Thailand. Dozens of rescuers were seen at work on Friday, entering and leaving the construction site, and the road was blocked with emergency service vehicles. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra visited the site of a building collapse as rescuers searched the rubble for survivors of Friday’s earthquake in the region.

At least 144 people were killed in Myanmar, the head of the military government said in the televised speech. “The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,”Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaingsaid, adding that more than 700 people had been injured. At least 10 died in the Thai capital, where a high-rise under construction collapsed. Damage was also reported in China. The quake struck in the early afternoon, sending people streaming out of buildings and seeking shelter anywhere they could find it from the blazing sun. Myanmar’s military-run government has declared a state of emergency in six regions. Here is the latest: The United Nations’s emergency relief coordinator made an initial allocation of $5 million for recovery efforts in the area as the international body works to recover from massive U.S. funding cuts to the region even before the 7.7 magnitude quake hit. Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesperson, told reporters that the allocation was made as international and local U.N. staff are working to gather information on the number of people impacted, damage to infrastructure and the scope of the humanitarian needs. “The earthquake will compound an already dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar, where nearly 20 million people need assistance across the country, including more than 3.5 million people displaced from their homes,” Dujarric said at a briefing Friday.  “The impact of the earthquake in Myanmar is likely to be severe, with possibly thousands of displaced people in need of urgent shelter, food and medical aid,” said Mohammed Riyas, regional director of the International Rescue Committee. “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” he said. “The damage to infrastructure and homes, loss of life, and injuries sustained by communities affected should not be underestimated.” Riyas said the IRC and its partners are working to understand how communities have been affected with the aim of launching an emergency response. He said in a statement that “search and rescue operations are underway.” Pope Francis, who is convalescing after a five-week hospitalization for life-threatening double pneumonia,offered prayersto the victims of the earthquake. “The pope has been informed of the disaster in Myanmar and is praying for the dramatic situation and for the many victims, also in Thailand,’’ the Vatican said in a statement. The earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, including the Ma Soe Yane monastery. A video posted online showed robed monks in the street shooting video of the multistory monastery before it suddenly fell into the ground. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed. Christian Aid said its partners and colleagues on the ground reported that a dam burst in the city, causing water levels to rise in the lowland areas in the area. The Red Cross said downed power lines added to challenges for their teams trying to reach several hard-hit areas. In Mandalay, which was close to the epicenter, the earthquake damaged part of the former royal palace and buildings, according to videos and photos released on Facebook social media. In the Sagaing region, southwest of Mandalay, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were damaged. In the capital Naypyitaw, the quake damaged religious shrines, sending parts toppling to the ground. Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, a military government spokesperson, told state television MRTV that blood was in high demand in the hospitals in earthquake-hit areas, especially Mandalay, Sagaing, and Naypyitaw. He urged blood donors to contact the hospitals as soon as possible. The Red Cross said downed power lines are adding to challenges for their teams trying to reach Mandalay and Sagaing regions and southern Shan state. “Initial reports from the ground suggest the earthquake has caused significant damage,” the Red Cross said. “Information on humanitarian needs is still being gathered.” A state of emergency has been declared in six regions and states in Myanmar by the military-run government. State-run MRTV television said the government’s proclamation includes the capital Naypyitaw and Mandalay, after the earthquake and a strong aftershock, whose epicenter was near the country’s second largest city. Myanmar is in the midst of a civil war and many areas are not easily accessible and it was not immediately clear what relief efforts the military would be able to provide. Thai emergency responders said at least two people have been found dead and an unknown number of others are still under the rubble of a collapsed building in Bangkok. Rescue worker Songwut Wangpon, speaking at the scene of a tall pile of rubble that was once a high-rise building under construction, told reporters another seven people had been found alive. Thailand’s Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai later said three people had been confirmed dead with 90 others missing following the building collapse. The collapse of the multi-story structure sent a crane on top of it toppling to the ground and created a massive plume of dust. People in the Silom business district of Bangkok evacuated office buildings and condominium towers along Rama IV Road and streamed into nearby Lumphini Park. The sidewalks filled with work crews with neon green shirts, along with other workers in hard hats and blue and green uniform shirts. Along the walkways of the park and the sidewalks of Silom and nearby Sathon, people in business attire and company uniforms huddled or stood in packs talking and checking their phones. Some moving through the crowds were crying or visibly distraught. Paul Vincent, a tourist visiting from England, was at a streetside bar when the quake struck. “The next thing, everybody came on the street, so there was a lot of screaming and panicking, which obviously made it a lot worse,” he said. As he came onto the street himself, he said he saw a high-rise building swaying and water was falling from a rooftop pool. “When I saw the building, oh my God, that’s when ... it hit me,” he said. “There were people crying in the streets and, you know, the panic was horrendous really.” The earthquake was felt in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China and caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports. Videos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher toward an ambulance. The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said she has ordered relevant agencies to prepare and work to relieve the situation and warned of possible aftershocks. She didn’t mention any casualties. “I’d like to ask everyone to stay calm and do not panic, but please be careful.” Bangkok City Hall has declared Bangkok an area of disaster.

"A remote Australian town seeks a doctor, offering a $400,000 salary and free rent",https://apnews.com/article/australia-doctor-julia-creek-rural-physician-outback-8004576f92a7d2652a8714e81d1642d6,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The Pony Club grounds in Julia Creek, a rural Queensland town with a population 500, Australia, Aug, 1, 2024. (Jo Thieme/ McKinlay Shire Council via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A remoteAustraliantown that will soon lose its only doctor is offering a salary of up to 680,000 Australian dollars ($428,000), plus free rent and a car, to attract a new candidate. The remote Queensland town of Julia Creek, population 500, is offering about double the salary a family physician would earn in the state’s capital, Brisbane. The catch is that Brisbane is a 17-hour drive away. The closest major city, Townsville, is a seven-hour drive. Prospective applicants must embrace searing heat and tropical insects, too. But the town’s outgoing medic, Dr. Adam Louws, says his replacement will also find a quieter pace of life and the chance to learn skills they’ve never used before. Louws was recruited from Brisbane in 2022, when Julia Creek drew national headlines for offering a salary of AU$500,000. “My mother-in-law sent me a link to this news article saying, ‘the half a million dollar job that no one wants,’” Louws said. “My first thought when I saw it and I looked at it was, where’s Julia Creek?” A sign in the main street of Julia Creek, a rural Queensland town of 500 people, Australia, Aug. 1, 2024. (Jo Thieme/ McKinlay Shire Council via AP)  Julia Creek is a sweeping, romantic slice of the Australian Outback with wide-open spaces and orange sunsets. Kids play sports and ride horses. But it’s remote — high school means boarding school in the city and the nearest hospital is nearly three hours’ drive away. Before Louws arrived in 2022, the town hadn’t had a permanent doctor for 15 years, with a roster of visiting physicians dropping in for short stays. It’s a problem that has vexed rural towns in Australia andaround the worldfor decades.  Australia has a shortfall of general practitioners of 2,500 doctors across the country, according to a 2024 government report, with the shortage worst in rural areas and expected to grow. Attracting doctors to rural Australia is made harder by the eye-watering distances between the most remote settlements; the vast country is one of the world’s least densely populated. In neighboring New Zealand — where 5 million people live in a country the size of the United Kingdom — distances between far-flung towns have worsened health disparities. In the United States, 65% of rural areas hada shortage of primary care physiciansin 2023, official figures showed. For Janene Fegan, the mayor of McKinlay Shire — which includes Julia Creek — that meant the town needed a good sales pitch. Fegan was involved in the local health service’s campaign that recruited Louws and offered to promote the town again when the job was advertised in March. “We actually have a very, very good lifestyle and a very safe lifestyle,” she said. “Yes, there is distance to travel at times, but how many people do you hear now wanting to escape from that and go off-grid?” The town was not, she added, literally off the grid: Julia Creek has electricity and broadband internet. “You don’t have to stay forever,” Fegan said. “Just give it a shot.” A photo showing an example of the rent-free housing available for medical workers in the Australian outback town of Julia Creek, taken on April 21, 2022. (Jo Thieme/ McKinlay Shire Council via AP)  When the job was advertised in 2022, some health care analysts said the bolstered salary still wasn’t enough to compensate for a solo doctor’s workload. But Louws, the departing doctor, said working solo prompted him to learn medical skills that he would have sent patients “two minutes down the road” for another practitioner to perform when he lived in the city. He also fulfilled a childhood dream of learning to milk dairy cows. “The money is plenty. It is,” Louws said. “One of the things that I think people don’t necessarily consider enough about this job is the other things that this town has to offer.” Louws applied for the job three days after first hearing about Julia Creek, following study on Wikipedia. Soon, he and his wife and four children were packing to move. When he’d been in the job six months, Louws said, he knew “nine out of 10” people in the town by name. “It feels kind of like stepping back in time about 60-odd years,” he said. “Everyone knows everyone.” At the end of his two year contract in Julia Creek, however, the distance from his extended family had taken a toll and he plans to return to his practice in the city. Louws departs in May; applications for his post close Sunday. He’s sorry to be leaving the “incredible” town. “It feels a lot closer,” the doctor said. “You get to really make a difference.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
Boys with cancer can face infertility as adults.

(UPMC/Pitt Health Sciences via AP)            WASHINGTON (AP) — A man who battled childhood cancer has received the first knowntransplant of sperm-producing stem cells, in a study aimed at restoring the fertility of cancer’s youngest survivors. Jaiwen Hsu was 11 when a leg injury turned out to be bone cancer. Doctors thoughtgrueling chemotherapycould save him but likely leave him infertile. His parents learned researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were freezing testicular cells ofyoung boys with cancerin hopes of preserving their future fertility — and signed him up. Hsu, now 26, is the first to return as an adult and test if reimplanting those cells might work. “The science behind it is so incredibly new that right now it’s kind of a waiting game,” said Hsu, of Vienna, Virginia. “It’s kind of eagerly crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.” It may seem unusual to discuss future fertility when a family is reeling from the diagnosis of a child’s cancer. But 85% of children with cancer now survive to adulthood and about 1 in 3 are left infertile from chemotherapy or radiation. Young adults with cancer can bank sperm, eggs or sometimes embryos ahead of treatment. But children diagnosed before puberty don’t have that option because they’re not yet producing mature sperm or eggs. Boys are born with stem cells inside spaghetti-like tubes in the testes, cells that start producing sperm after puberty sparks a rise in testosterone. Withfunding from the National Institutes of Health, Pitt reproductive scientist Kyle Orwig studies how to preserve and potentially use testicular cells to restore fertility.  It starts with a biopsy-like removal of a small amount of testicular tissue that contains millions of cells – some of them precious sperm-producing stem cells.Since 2011, Orwig’s team has frozen samplesfrom about 1,000 prepubertal boys. It’s impossible to tell if enough stem cells are in each tiny sample to matter. But in 2019, Orwig used preserved testicular tissue from a young male monkey that, in an animal version of IVF, led to the birth of a healthy baby monkey. By 2023, Orwig was ready to reimplant now-grown cancer survivors’ cells when Hsu — not ready to start a family yet but curious about his long-ago study participation — reached out. “We’re not expecting a miracle result,” cautioned Orwig, whose colleagues transplanted Hsu’s thawed cells in November 2023. In a paperposted onlinethis week, Orwig reported the injection, guided by ultrasound to the right spot, was safe and easy to perform. His work has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. And Orwig said it’s too soon to know if the experiment worked and standard tests likely won’t tell, as animal testing found assisted reproduction techniques were needed to detect and retrieve small amounts of sperm. Still, he hopes the ongoing research will alert more families to consider fertility preservation so they’d have the option if it eventually pans out. Belgian researchers announced a similar experiment in January, implanting pieces of testicular tissue rather than cells in a childhood cancer survivor. “These developments are of great importance,” said researcher Ellen Goossens of Vrije Universiteit Brussel. While animal research “was very promising, transplantations in humans will be the only way” to tell if this really works. Similar research with immature ovarian tissue is underway for female childhood cancer survivors, too, noted Dr. Mahmoud Salama, who directs the Oncofertility Consortium at Michigan State University. Hsu said even if his experimental transplant doesn’t work, it will guide further research. He’s grateful his parents years ago “made a call that gave me the option to make the choice for myself today.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(Pool via AP)         ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Billionaire Elon Musk says a Wisconsin voter has been awarded $1 million days before the conclusion of afiercely contested state Supreme Court electionthat has broken spending records and become areferendum on Musk and the first monthsof President Donald Trump’s administration. The payment to a Green Bay man, which Musk announced Wednesday night on his social media platform X, is similar to a lottery that Musk’s political action committee ran last year in Wisconsin and other battleground states before the presidential election in November. The upcoming election on Tuesday, filling a seat held by a liberal justice who is retiring, will determine whether Wisconsin’s highest court will remain under 4-3 liberal control or flip to a conservative majority. The race has becomea proxy battleover the nation’s politics, with Trump and Muskgetting behindBrad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate in the officially nonpartisan contest. The campaign for the Democratic-supported candidate, Susan Crawford, blasted the $1 million payment from Musk as an attempt to illegally buy influence on the court in a state where Tesla, his electric car company, has alawsuit pendingthat could end up before the court. “It’s corrupt, it’s extreme, and it’s disgraceful to our state and judiciary,” Crawford spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said in a statement.  No legal action against Musk’s payments to voters has been filed in Wisconsin with the Supreme Court election five days away. Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, said the payments were a last-minute attempt to influence the election. “Whether or not Wisconsinites will believe this is legitimate or not probably won’t be settled until after the election,” he said. “But this not what a Wisconsin Supreme Court election ought to be decided on. Races for the high court are supposed to be on judicial temperament and impartiality, not huge amounts of money for partisan purposes.” Musk’s political action committee, America First, announced last week that it wasoffering $100 to voterswho signed a petition in opposition to “activist judges.” He did not say there would be $1 million prizes at that time, but in hispost on Wednesdaysaid an additional $1 million award would be made in two days. It was not clear who determined the winner of the $1 million or how it was done. Musk’s political action committee useda nearly identical tacticbefore the White House election last year,offering to pay$1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. It is a felony in Wisconsin to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote. The Musk petition says it is open only to registered Wisconsin voters, but those who sign it are not required to show any proof that they actually voted. The petition says: “Judges should interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas. By signing below, I’m rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role — interpreting, not legislating.” The petition, while designed to collect data on Wisconsin voters and energize them, also is in line withTrump’s agendaalleging that “activist” judges are illegally working against him. Trump’s administration is embroiled in several lawsuits related to his flurry of executive orders and Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency effort todownsize the federal bureaucracy. During last year’s presidential race, Philadelphia’s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutorsfailed to showthe effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day. America PAC and Building for America’s Future, two groups that Musk funds, have spent more than $17 million trying to help elect Schimel, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice. Musk also has given the Wisconsin Republican Party $3 million this year, which it can then give to Schimel or spend on the race. More than $81 million has been spent on the race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.

Mississippi governor signs typo tax overhaul bill into law to phase out income tax,https://apnews.com/us-news/taxes-tate-reeves-mississippi-general-news-573ad75c52cb94af8f8adc90d1cd5e96,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Gov. Tate Reeves signed a bill to overhaul Mississippi’s tax system — one that many lawmakers inadvertently voted for because of typos — into law on Thursday. This sets Mississippi on a path to become the first state to eliminate an existing income tax, when the tax is phased out in about 14 years. Reeves said the law marks a turning point in the state’s history and that it would make Mississippi a magnet for corporate investment and workers from other states. “Today is a day that will be remembered not just for the headlines, not just for the politics, but for the profound generational change it represents,” Reeves said at a bill signing ceremony in front of the Governor’s Mansion. “I must say, it feels like it’s been a long time coming, but after many, many, many years of hard work, we can all stand together and say that we have accomplished income tax elimination in the state of Mississippi.” Mississippi is currently reducing its income tax rate to 4% from a previously passed tax cut being phased in. Beginning in 2027, the new law will reduce that rate by .25% over four years until it reaches 3%. In 2031, the tax will only be reduced if certain revenue “growth triggers” are met. The law also reduces the sales tax on groceries from 7% to 5%, raises the gasoline tax from 18.4 cents a gallon to 27.4 cents a gallon over three years to fund infrastructure and changes the contribution model of the public employee retirement system.  House leaders have long pushed to eliminate the state personal income tax in relatively short order. The Senate had urged a longer-term approach, arguing it would be unwise to slash a third of the state’s revenue in uncertain economic times. Senators last week had conceded to eliminate the income tax, but only with economic growth “triggers” as safeguards — the tax wouldn’t phase out unless the state saw robust economic growth and controlled spending. It would have likely taken many years. Or so they thought. The Senate bill had typos that essentially nullified the growth triggers and would eliminate the income tax nearly as quickly as the House proposed. The House passed the flawed bill on to the governor, who signed it into law Thursday. In a social media post last week, Reeves, who did not mention the bizarre series of events that helped send the bill to his desk, said “liberal activists” were “making claims of errors, omissions, mistakes, and changes.” Since then, both House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov Delbert Hosemann, both Republicans, have acknowledged the legislation signed into law Thursday contained errors. Hosemann downplayed the typos at the ceremony. “Some of y’all are focused on a typo in the bill, and I’d use the biblical analogy, let he who has not had a typo cast the first stone.” Reeves said the tax overhaul will lead to economic dynamism and attract new residents to Mississippi, but local officials and experts remain divided on whether eliminating the tax will actually benefit the state’s economy and whether citizens will reap many of the benefits that politicians claim they will. Neva Butkus, a senior analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said her projections show that once Mississippi abolishes its income tax, it will likely result in a $2.6 billion reduction to the current $7 billion general fund budget, revenue that the poorest state in the nation could use to provide core government services. “What the state is essentially committing to is a very extreme and dramatic loss of revenue during a very tumultuous time during which the state might be reckoning with large federal cuts to social programs that many Mississippians rely on,” Butkus said. “And they’re doing all of this while creating a windfall for the state’s wealthiest residents in the poorest state in the union.” Mississippi’s decision to eliminate the tax without raising another tax to offset the general fund loss comes as President Donald Trump’s administration and the GOP-controlled Congress are considering sweeping budget cuts and freezing federal grants that fund many state services. Mississippi’s economy and budget are among the most reliant on federal spending in the nation. If the federal government significantly slashes any federal programs, the impact will almost certainly trickle down to the state level. The ITEP’s data shows that Mississippians who make less than $19,300 a year, the poorest of the poor, already spend around 12.4% of their income on taxes. In comparison, Mississippians who make over $362,000 annually only contribute 6.9% of their income to taxes. Once the tax cuts take full effect, Butkus said that disparity is expected to widen even more, especially since the new law will raise the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon to fund road and bridge infrastructure. “When you’re replacing progressive income taxes with regressive revenue, that becomes a problem,” Butkus said. Conversely, Joe Bishop-Henchman, the executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, believes the law’s growth triggers — even with the errant decimal point typos defanging them — mean the state can responsibly eliminate the tax without decimating its budget. Bishop-Henchman has previously testified before the state Legislature about tax policy and said it would be ideal for lawmakers to correct the typos in the trigger language, but having some type of guardrails in place is something multiple states have enacted. “A value of triggers is that it still leaves room for budget growth,” Bishop-Henchman said. Mississippi Today spoke to mayors around the state, who were also divided on some elements of the overhaul. Shari Veazey, executive director of the Mississippi Municipal League, a lobbying organization that represents cities and towns, said the entity did not oppose the bill signed by Reeves because it diverts more state money from the sale tax on groceries to localities, even though the overall sales tax rate on groceries was reduced. “The number one priority was just making sure there was no loss of revenue when they reduced the grocery sales tax,” Veazey said. “And we don’t believe there will be.” Veazey said the impact on municipalities of shrinking the state general fund budget remains to be seen. Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill said she had been assured by the area’s state legislators that city budgets would be kept afloat. “The proof will be in the numbers we receive when it goes into effect,” Spruill said. “I’m relying on our legislators being accurate.” She said cuts to the general fund might not have a big impact on her city’s ability to function, but individual taxpayers might have cause for concern. “I would worry about it as a resident who pays taxes, as to what that will do to the basic services the state provides,” Spruill added. “But as it relates to a direct appropriation to the city, that’s not something I’m particularly concerned about.” The gas tax increase could cause some financial hardship, Spruill said. But Starkville, home to Mississippi State University, has better public transportation than most cities in the state. But in a place such as Greenville, located in the rural, poverty-stricken Mississippi Delta, some worry a slashed general fund alongside gas tax increases could make it more expensive to drive and weaken local government’s ability to provide basic services. “The trickle-down negative effects of this tax overhaul will not actually trickle down—it will be a huge take-away from this rural community,” said Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons. “When local governments lose the ability to fund police, fire, and other essential services, the safety and well-being of our residents are put at risk.” In Greenwood, located at the eastern edge of the Delta, Mayor Carolyn McAdams, said she was concerned that the law’s increased grocery sales tax diversion might not be enough to make up for revenue small towns might lose. “The people in these small towns like Itta Bena, Sidon, Schlater only have these convenience stores and they don’t even have grocery stores. What is that going to do to these small towns?” McAdams said. “I have to trust that they’re going to take all of that into consideration and not do anything that would be harmful to the cities and towns that make up Mississippi.” Reeves said the benefits would outweigh the costs: “We are saying to entrepreneurs, to workers, to dreamers: Mississippi is open for business, and we will not penalize your success. We are going to compete and we are going to win.” This story was originally published byMississippi Todayand distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.

What is ‘classified’ information? What are ‘secure’ communications?

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)     WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration’s use of a popular messaging app to discuss sensitive military plans — with a journalist onthe text chain— israising questionsabout security and the importance of safeguarding the nation’s secrets. It’s also highlighting the differences between classified and public information, and demonstrating that even encrypted apps like Signal can lead to embarrassing leaks if the humans doing the texting don’t follow basic security tips. President Donald Trump’sadministration says no classified material was leakedwhen senior officials used Signal to discuss upcoming attack plans against the Houthi rebels in Yemen — even though a journalist was on the chat. But even if the information had been declassified by the Pentagon, it contained details that would have been highly valuable to the Houthis or other adversaries, showing how sometimes the decision of what to classify is a judgment call. The federal government routinely classifies vast amounts of information pertaining to military and intelligence operations. The material ranges from top secret nuclear programs or the identities of undercover agents all the way to mundane records that would be of little interest to anyone, let alone America’s adversaries. In 2011, for example, the CIA finally declassified itsrecipe for invisible ink— from 1917. Advocates for open government have long complained that the push for secrecy goes too far, by protecting information that could shine a light on government activities or matters of public interest, including aboutUFO sightingsand a60-year-old presidential assassination.  While the public typically calls any information withheld by the government “classified,” that term only refers to the three broad categories used to “classify” information based on the need for secrecy: confidential, secret and top secret. While files marked “confidential” contain information that’s not meant to be released, the need for security or access restrictions isn’t as great as for material considered “top secret,” which includes the nation’s nuclear secrets and other material that, if released, could pose a grave danger to national security. While the Pentagon hasn’t offered classification details about the information in the Signal chats, information about upcoming military strikes is typically tightly guarded to ensure adversaries don’t have advance warning that could jeopardize the mission or put American service members at risk. The Pentagon closely guards even some publicly available information. Material categorized as “controlled unclassified information,” while not secret, is still considered sensitive enough that military service members are prohibited from discussing it on unsecured devices like personal phones. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were asked about that policy during a Senate hearing this week as they were grilled over the Signal chat. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona noted that Department of Defense policy “prohibits discussion of even what is called controlled unclassified information on unsecured devices,” and asked if Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who oversees the nation’s 18 intelligence agencies, were aware of that rule. “I haven’t read that policy,” Gabbard said. “I’m not familiar with the DOD policy,” Ratcliffe said. The power to classify or declassify lies in the hands of top federal officials, including the president and Cabinet secretaries. For military information like the attack plans discussed over Signal, the power lies with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced demands that he resign over the leak. The president’s ability to declassify information has been invoked when presidents have been accused of mishandling secrets. Trump ally Kash Patel, now the FBI director, hassaid he witnessed Trump declassify materialthat was taken after his first term to the president’s Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, but no evidence has emerged to support that claim. The Pentagon hasn’t said whether Hegseth declassified the attack plans before or after the Signal conversation, but Ratcliffe, Gabbard and the White House have all said the chats contained no classified information. “I haven’t participated in any Signal group messaging that relates to any classified information at all,” Ratcliffe proclaimed at one point. That explanation has failed to satisfy Democrats who say that plans for imminent military strikes are regularly classified. National security experts agree. They say it would be highly unusual for the Pentagon to publicize such information and that any lower-level officer caught leaking such material on Signal would face serious repercussions. For many consumers, encrypted apps likeSignalcan offer greater protections for everyday conversations. But that doesn’t mean they’re secure enough for government secrets, or immune to human error, as the inclusion of a reporter on the text chain shows. Senior federal officials who handle classified data receive extensive training about the need to use approved devices and platforms to discuss government secrets. Intelligence and national security agencies have whole departments devoted to cybersecurity and the protection of state secrets. Government cybersecurity officials haverecommendedthat federal employees use encrypted apps like Signal, which can offer greater security for routine communication, and Ratcliffe said this week it was a “permissible” app for senior officials to use. But the app is only as secure as the device it’s downloaded onto. The government’s most sensitive information is typically discussed in a facility known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, which is designed to allow officials to review or discuss secrets without fear of eavesdropping or cyber intrusion. Any senior official using a personal device to discuss classified material could be at risk of cyberespionage, said Michael Williams, an expert on international relations and national security at Syracuse University. “Signal may be encrypted, but it’s the devices that are really the issue,” Williams said. “All of these people are being targeted.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt York) NEW YORK (AP) — Cuba had a record 26 players on Major League Baseball’s opening day rosters and Japan had 12 for its most since 2012. The percentage born outside the 50 states remained at 27.8%, matching its lowest level since 2016. There were 265 players from 18 nations and territories outside of the 50 states among 954 players on opening day active rosters and injured, restricted and inactive lists, the commissioner’s office said Friday. Cuba’s total topped its previous high of 23 in 2016, 2017 and 2022. Japan’s total was its most since 13 in 2012. The overall percentage matched last year and was down 28.5% in 2023, which was the lowest since 27.5% in 2016. It has remained in the 26-29.8% range since 2002, peaking in 2017. The total international players was the fourth-highest behind 291 in 2020 (when there were expanded 30-man active rosters), 275 in 2022 (when there were expanded 28-man active rosters) and 270 in 2023. The Dominican Republic led countries outside the U.S. with 100, down from 108 last year and 110 in 2020. Canada’s 13 matched last year for its most since 17 in 2013. Venezuela was second at 63, followed by Cuba (26), Puerto Rico (16), Canada (13), Japan (12), Mexico (11), Curacao and Panama (four), South Korea (three), Aruba, Australia and Colombia (two) and Bahamas, Brazil, Germany, Honduras, Nicaragua and South Africa (one apiece). Atlanta catcher Chadwick Tromp joined San Diego infielder Xander Bogaerts to give Aruba two players for the first time.  San Francisco’s Jung Hoo Lee and Philadelphia’s Jesús Luzardo were listed as miscellaneous, Lee as born in Japan of South Korean descent and Luzardo as born in Peru of Venezuelan descent. Houston and San Diego topped teams with 16 international players each, with the Astros having a share of the lead for the fifth straight season. They were followed by Atlanta (14), the New York Mets (13) and Baltimore and Miami (12 each). The 18 nations and territories outside the U.S. matched last year and were three shy of the high, set in 2018 and matched in 2022.

A federal judge temporarily blocks parts of Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders,https://apnews.com/article/dei-trump-executive-order-chicago-women-d84ed0d8d77146f27570595513046ae5,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he signs executive orders in the White House, Feb. 4, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) CHICAGO (AP) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing parts of President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients. Judge Matthew Kennelly of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois halted the Labor Department from requiring federal contractors or grant recipients from certifying that they don’t operate any programs in violation of Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders. That certification provisionhas stepped up pressure on companiesand other organizations to revisit their DEI practices because if the government were to determine they violated the provision, they would be subject to crippling financial penalties under the False Claims Act. Thursday’s ruling is in response to a lawsuit filed last month by Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit founded in 1981 that helps prepare women for work in skilled construction trades and has several grants from with the Department of Labor. The organization argued that the president’s executive orders on DEI are so broad and vague that the organization had no way to ensure compliance, and thus they threaten its core mission. The judge also blocked the Labor Department from freezing or canceling any funding with Chicago Women in Trades, and the Trump administration from pursuing any False Claims Act enforcement against them. “This is a critical step in ensuring that the organization can continue the important work it leads — helping women put food on the table through careers in the skilled trades and making job sites safer for thousands of women over the last four decades,” Sabrina Talukder, a senior counsel with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is representing the organization, said in a statement.  The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A hearing on Chicago Women in Trades’ bid for a longer-lasting halt on Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders is scheduled for April 10. The organization’s lawsuit is one of several challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting DEI programs in both the private and public sectors. Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all “equity-related” grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order that included a requirement that federal contractors and grantees certify that they don’t “operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.” Kennelly’s decision comes nearly two weeks after anappeals court lifted a broader nationwide injunctionagainst Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders in a separate lawsuit in Baltimore. But Thursday’s ruling is limited in scope because Kennelly declined to extend the temporary restraining order to other federal agencies. Kennelly wrote that Chicago Women in Trades was likely to succeed in its arguments that parts of the executive orders are a violation of free speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague. Although the government argued that the certification provision “implicates only illegal DEI programs, it has studiously declined to shed any light on what this means. The answer is anything but obvious,” Kennelly wrote. Kennelly wrote that he extended his order to all Labor Department contractors and grant recipients because the vagueness of Trump’s executive orders, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, would likely pressure organizations to curb DEI programs in potential violation of free speech rights. Rather than face potentially crippling penalties, “it is likely that many of these grantees will take the safer route and choose to simply stop speaking on anything remotely related to what the government might consider to promote DEI or equity. A nationwide restraining order is appropriate to protect grantees who cannot afford the risks inherent in biting the hand that feeds them,” Kennelly wrote. During a hearing on Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Chicago Women in Trades’ motion for relief was premature because it was based on speculation as to how the executive orders will be implemented. But Kennelly wrote that said the concern that grant recipients “may be targeted by the Certification Provision is anything but speculative.” He noted that 60 organizations, including Chicago Women in Trades, received an email on March 20 from the Department of Labor instructing them to “immediately cease all activities related to DEI” consistent with the executive orders. Kennelly also noted Chicago Women in Trades lost a subcontract with a DOL contractor trying to comply with the executive order. Chicago Women in Trades has a long history of partnering with companies, state and federal agencies and other industry stakeholders trying to recruit more women into skilled trades. Its grant work with the federal government dates back years, including two grants awarded under the first Trump administration under theWomen in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupationsinitiative, which aims to expand pathways for women seeking to enter skilled trades.

Trump claimed there has been a “concerted and widespread” effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing “objective facts” with a “distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,” adding that it casts the “founding principles” of the United States in a “negative light.”  The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice PresidentJD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution’s Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to “remove improper ideology” from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo. People gather for a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery to announce the installation of a life-size painting of President Abraham Lincoln by artist W.F.K. Travers, Feb. 10, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)   It marks the Republican president’s latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently hadhimself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Artswith the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recentlyforced Columbia University to make a series of policy changesby threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.  The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing ofGeorge Floydin Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.   The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the250th anniversaryof the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  Trump singled out theNational Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women’s History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.  “Museums in our Nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,” he said.  Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution’s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, “We have no comment for now.”  Under Trump’s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn’t spent on programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.” Trump also wants to ensure that the women’s history museum celebrates women and not “recognize men as women in any respect.”  It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to “perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.”  The Smithsonian Institution is the world’s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.  The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found “at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

If the first half of the Sweet 16 is any indication, the second half will be elite. The East and West regional finals are set after some scintillating performances on Thursday. The nets in Newark, New Jersey, may have to be replaced after Alabama broke the NCAA Tournament record with 25 3-pointersin a 113-88 blowout of BYU. Mark Sears led the Tide, hitting 10 3s while scoring 35 points. The Crimson Tide will face Duke and fabulous freshman Cooper Flagg, who set up a showdown between the East Region’s top two seeds with a stellar all-around performance in theBlue Devils’ 100-93 winover Arizona.

Live updates: Vance tours a US military base in Greenland following uproar over uninvited visit,https://apnews.com/live/donald-trump-news-updates-3-28-2025,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that he’s joining his wife on a Friday trip to Greenland, suggesting in an online video that global security is at stake. (AP video shot by: David Keyton) Vice President JD Vance, his wife and other senior U.S. officials are due to visit an American military base inGreenlandon Friday in a trip that was scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were irked that the original itinerary was planned without consulting them. Other news we’re following:  As many as 10,000 employees are expected to start receiving termination notices as soon as today, according to an emailed notice union representatives received from the department on Thursday. The notice says between 8,000 and 10,000 people will be terminated. Public health agencies are expected to be hit hardest, with HHS saying on Thursday it will eliminate 3,500 people from the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects prescriptions and foods; 2,400 jobs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and 1,200 jobs at the National Institutes of Health. Habbawas sworn into office by Attorney General Pam Bondi in a ceremony held in the Oval Office as Trump looked on. The New Jersey native defended Trump in some of his civil lawsuits. He later brought her to the White House with the title of counselor to the president. “She counseled me very well,” Trump said. He said she’ll work “tirelessly to weed out crime and corruption and restore law and order to the Garden State.” Habba thanked the president and said, “I would not be standing here today if it was not for the man to my right,” meaning Trump. She promised to “make New Jersey great again.” Freedom of press advocates are asking a federal court in California to rule that Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service is subject to the federal Freedom of Information Act and to comply with FOIA requests made of it. The nonprofit First Amendment Coalition and MSW Media, a female-led podcast network, filed on Friday in the U.S. District for Northern California. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled earlier in March that the U.S. DOGE Service was likely subject to FOIA and issued a preliminary injunction requiring the preservation of documents in a case brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. The plaintiffs in California have sought emails and other electronic text communications sent or received by Musk and by Department of Government Efficiency employees. The agency has not responded to the FOIA requests. As Vance visits the island, Trump was asked if the trip could mean a larger U.S. military presence being deployed there eventually. Trump didn’t answer the question. Instead, he told reporters in the Oval Office, “We get along very well with Greenland.” “I think everybody wants to see that work out,” Trump said of the U.S. controlling the island, which is a Danish territory. He also said the U.S. gets along well with Denmark. Trump added, “We need Greenland” for “international security.” The president repeated his previous claims that many countries have military and other ships in waters around Greenland. He said greater U.S. influence in Greenland is “important for the peace of the world.” Trump says Rep. Elise Stefanik did him “a big favor” by agreeing to stay in Congress instead of going to the UN. Trump announced Thursday that he hadpulled the New York Republican’s nominationas U.N. ambassador, saying he was concerned about Republicans’ razor-thin majority in the House. He said Friday that he didn’t want to riskDemocrats possibly winningFlorida’s two special elections for the U.S. House next week. He noted all the money the party has spent to flip those seats. “We don’t want to take any chances. It’s as simple as that. It’s basic politics,” he said. Asked if Americans should buy their cars now to avoid higher prices from his 25% tariffs, the president suggested they had little reason for concern. “No, I don’t think so,” Trump said about people pulling forward their auto purchases. Trump is betting that his tariffs will cause the U.S. economy to boom. But his threats of multiple tariffs, with autos being just the latest example, have caused consumer sentiment to slump as people fear higher prices and fewer job opportunities.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  A Musk associate sounded a death knell Friday for most remaining staffers and independent functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development, asserting that “substantially all” USAID positions not required by law would be eliminated. Jeremy Lewin, a former member of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency teams appointed to senior duties at the agency earlier this month, also asserted that the allows the Trump administration to eliminate the agency’s “independent operation.” Lewin’s announcement appeared in a notice to USAID staff obtained by The Associated Press. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a separate notice that the administration had formally notified Congress Friday of its plans. The S&P 500 fell 2% Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 722 points, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.7%. Lululemon Athletica had stronger profits last quarter but lost 14.8%, after the sportswear maker warned of slowing revenue growth with shoppers spending less because of concerns about inflation and the economy. It was just the latest in a line of retailers making similar warnings. Markets could remain shaky worldwide as Trump’s April 2 deadline for more tariffs approaches. Treasury yields also fell despite a worse-than-expected report on inflation. A report on Friday morning showed all types of U.S. consumers are getting more pessimistic about their future finances, including Republicans, independents and Democrats. ▶Read more onreactions to Trump’s market-moving decisions Vice President JD Vance, left, and second lady Usha Vance pose during a tour of Pituffik Space Base, Friday, March 28, 2025, in Greenland. (Jim Watson/Pool via AP)  Vance and the second lady entered the mess hall at Pituffik Space Base and used some colorful language to describe the freezing temperatures outside. “It’s cold as s--t here. Nobody told me,” Vance said, drawing laughs. Temperatures in Greenland were around -5 Fahrenheit. The vice president said the flight from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to Greenland was beautiful. “The president is really interested in Arctic security, as you all know,” Vance said. “And it’s only going to get bigger over the coming decades.” Sen. Patty Murray said the Trump administration and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are putting Americans’ lives in jeopardy. During a call with the nation’s top former public health officials, the Democratic senator and others warned that nursing home safety, food and drug inspections, and clinical trials and scientific research are all being disrupted and dismantled by the DOGE cuts. Murray said Americans need to know what’s at stake. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient “sprawling bureaucracy” in a video announcing the restructuring, and faulted its 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans’ health. “I want to promise you now that we’re going to do more with less,” Kennedy said. ▶Read more onthe impact of cuts at Health and Human Services Elon Musk attends the finals for the NCAA wrestling championship, Saturday, March 22, 2025, in Philadelphia.

The post disappeared from Musk’s social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. Musk had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election that will determine ideological control of the court. Wisconsin law explicitly prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for a vote. Their letter to Pam Bondi says the firing of 20 immigration judges in February could add to the strain on backlogged immigration courts. Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrats on committees overseeing the judicial system, along with over 60 other Democratic lawmakers, said the dismissal of the judges “is particularly baffling, given the immense pressure the immigration courts are under to adjudicate roughly 3.6 million immigration cases.” Democrats have sought to provide more funding for immigration judges, but Trump is bypassing legal reviews as he tries to quickly remove migrants. Vice President JD Vance arrives at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, Friday, March 28, 2025. (Jim Watson/Pool via AP)  Soon after arriving, JD and Usha Vance sat down for lunch with American troops stationed at the Pituffik Space Base for lunch. Vance told them he’s “really interested in Arctic security.” “As you all know, it’s a big issue and it’s only going to get bigger over the coming decades,” Vance said. Following the lunch, Vance was scheduled to receive briefings from military officials and deliver more formal remarks to troops.

Before the Trump cuts to foreign aid, USAID-backed search and rescue teams from Los Angeles County and Fairfax County, Virginia, could head off to distant quakes in as few as 24 hours, said Sarah Charles, who oversaw the teams in the Biden administration. The Trump administration is believed to have cut the commercial-transport contracts that get disaster crews, their dog search teams, and heavy equipment to disasters to pull out survivors and bodies, Charles said. Now, as Trump faces the first major natural disaster of his second term, “the well-built system that we had … those are in shambles,” Charles said. ▶ Read moreabout responses to Friday’s earthquake Vice President JD Vance, right, and second lady Usha Vance arrive at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, Friday, March 28, 2025.

The itinerary change removed the risk of potentially violating diplomatic custom by sending a delegation without an official invitation. It also reduces the likelihood that Vance and his wife will cross paths with residents angered by Trump’s announcements. During his visit, Vance was expected to receive briefings and deliver remarks to U.S. service members, according to the vice president’s office. His delegation includes the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, as well as second lady Usha Vance. ▶Read moreabout the northernmost US base Independent presidential candidate Robert F.

That comment drew nervous laughter from the crowd in West Virginia, which this week became the first state tosign a sweeping statewide banon synthetic dyes in cereals, drinks and candies. Kennedy and Morrisey also talked about adding more restrictions to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that millions of poor Americans use to buy food. The U.S. president, in a social media post, called it an “extremely productive call.” “We agree on many things, and will be meeting immediately after Canada’s upcoming Election to work on elements of Politics, Business, and all other factors, that will end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada,” Trump wrote.

It provides grants and contracts that have amounted to close to half the total revenue of some research universities, according to an Associated Press analysis. Trump has been using the funding spigot to seek compliance with his agenda, threatening to cut money for schools the administration has deemed as illegallypushing diversity, equity and inclusionor for not doing enough tocombat antisemitism. The AP analysis looked at federal funding for nearly 100 colleges currently under investigation. For most, around 10% to 13% of their revenue is federal money.

Among Republicans, this dropped from 55% to 44%. Very few see the U.S. and Canada as outright “enemies.” Almost no Americans see either Russia or China as a close ally. “He’s turning everybody against us,” bemoaned Lynn Huster, a Democrat in York, Pennsylvania.

Economists watch core prices as a better guide of where inflation is headed. Inflation remains a top economic concern for most Americans, even as it has fallen sharply from its 2022 peak.

The order, signed without public fanfare and announced late Thursday, appears to touch most of the federal government. Affected agencies include the Departments of State, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Health and Human Services, Treasury, Justice and Commerce and the part of Homeland Security responsible for border security. Police and firefighters will continue to collectively bargain. Trump said the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 gives him the authority to end collective bargaining with federal unions in these agencies because of their role in safeguarding national security. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 820,000 federal and D.C. government workers, said late Thursday that it is “preparing immediate legal action and will fight relentlessly to protect our rights, our members, and all working Americans from these unprecedented attacks.” ▶Read moreabout Trump’s order on collective bargaining Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved. Trevor Milton, left, leaves the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse on Monday, Sept. 12, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Brittainy Newman, File) Trevor Milton, the founder of electric vehicle start-up Nikola who was sentenced to prison last year, was pardoned by President Donald Trump, the White House confirmed Friday. The pardon of Milton, who was sentenced to four years in prison for exaggerating the potential of his technology, could wipe out hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution that prosecutors were seeking for defrauded investors. Milton and his wife donated more than $1.8 million to a Trump re-election campaign fund less than a month before the November election, according to the Federal Election Commission. At Milton’s trial, prosecutors say a company video of a prototype truck appearing to be driven down a desert highway was actually a video of a nonfunctioning Nikola that had been rolled down a hill. Milton had not been incarcerated pending an appeal. Milton said late Thursday on social media that he had been pardoned by Trump. “I am incredibly grateful to President Trump for his courage in standing up for what is right and for granting me this sacred pardon of innocence,” Milton said. The White House confirmed the pardon Friday, though there was no notice of a pardon on the White House website. Trump wasted little time in using his pardon power since beginning his second term. Hours after taking office, he wiped clean the records of roughly 1,500 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. The next day, Trump announced that he hadpardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, an underground website for selling drugs.  Ulbricht had beensentenced to life in prisonin 2015 after a high-profile prosecution that highlighted the role of the internet in illegal markets. Nikola, which was a hot start-up and rising star on Wall Street before becomingenmeshed in scandal, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February. Milton, convicted of fraud, was portrayed by prosecutors as a con man six years after he had founded the company in a basement in Utah. Prosecutors said Milton falsely claimed to have built its own revolutionary truck that was actually a General Motors product with Nikola’s logo stamped onto it. Called as a government witness,Nikola’s CEO testifiedthat Milton “was prone to exaggeration” when pitching his venture to investors. Milton resigned in 2020 amid reports of fraud that sent Nikola’s stock prices into a tailspin. Investors suffered heavy losses as reports questioned Milton’s claims that the company had already produced zero-emission 18-wheel trucks. The company paid $125 million in 2021 tosettlea civil case against it by the SEC. Nikola didn’t admit any wrongdoing. A voicemail left with the U.S. District Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, was not immediately returned. At the time of his conviction U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, “Trevor Milton lied to investors again and again — on social media, on television, on podcasts, and in print. But today’s sentence should be a warning to start-up founders and corporate executives everywhere — ‘fake it till you make it’ is not an excuse for fraud, and if you mislead your investors, you will pay a stiff price.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kate Payne)                       TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Democrats, with few electoral outlets for their outrage at President Donald Trump’s dramatic restructuring of the federal government, are pouring millions of dollars intotwo special electionsin Florida. That’s whereDemocratic candidatesare trying to accomplish the improbable by flipping a pair ofTrump-friendly congressional seatsand carving into Republicans’ narrow 218 to 213 majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. While Democratic leaders aren’t predicting outright wins in such Republican-leaning districts, they say they think they’ll exceed expectations. And they sound especially hopeful about the 6th Congressional District, where a public school teacher has out raised a Trump-endorsed state senator by a nearly 10-to-1 margin in the race to replace Mike Waltz, who was tapped by Trump to be anational security adviserin what was widely seen as a move without much political risk. Democrats’ challenge in both districts is formidable, but the money has been pouring in. “The floodgates have really opened,” said Aubrey Jewett, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida. “It’s like, wow.” Republicans, including Trump, have noticed too, and are looking to head off an embarrassing outcome. The president joined both Republican candidates by telephone on separate tele-town halls Thursday to help get out the vote in the “all-important” elections.  Winning both races next Tuesday would be colossal for a Democratic Party that has struggled to settle on a way to push back during the early days of the second Trump administration. Winning either — or even narrowing the margin in districts the president won by more than 30 points less than five months ago — could help alleviate the panic that set in among party leaders after Republicans swept both houses of Congress and the presidency in November. National Democrats point to the fundraising hauls in some of the most conservative parts of Florida as a sign that voters are already fed up with the president’saggressive second term, a message they’re hoping to parlay into grassroots support — and more money — ahead of the 2026 midterms. Voters in Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts will be among the first to put the new administration to an electoral test in the April 1 special elections to fill seats once held by former Reps.Matt GaetzandWaltz, who were both tapped to join the Trump administration. Gaetzwithdrew from considerationto beattorney generalamidallegations of sexual misconduct, whichhe has denied. Waltz currently finds himself at the center of controversy over thetexting of sensitive military plansfor an attack on Houthis in Yemen to a group that included a journalist. Democrats Gay Valimont in the 1st District and Josh Weil in the 6th District have both far outraised and outspent their Trump-backed Republican competitors, in districts the president won by 30 points or more in 2024. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who’s running in the 1st District, and state Sen. Randy Fine in the 6th District have both campaigned as staunch allies of the president, whoendorsed them in the primary. But with donations for the Democrats flooding in from all 50 states, Republicans are funneling resources into the races in the hopes the GOP won’t “get embarrassed” Tuesday by a better-than-expected showing by Democrats. “I want it to be a landslide,” said Doug Stauffer, chair of the GOP in Okaloosa County, which is part of the 1st District. “And if it’s not, then we haven’t done the right thing for the constituents.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is already pushing the message that if Democrats overperform in the districts, resistance to Trump’s second term could help them take back the House in 2026. “These are races that should not under ordinary circumstances be on anyone’s political radar. They are safe Republican seats that Donald Trump won by more than 30 points,” Jeffries told reporters this week. “The American people are not buying what the Republicans are selling. That is why they are on the run.” In the 6th District, which extends north of Orlando, Florida, Weil has pulled in an eye-popping $9 million, according to the most recent campaign finance reports. That’s nearly 10 times the fundraising reported by Fine, a self-described “conservative firebrand” and former gambling industry executive known for his anti-LGBTQ stances and combative approach to politics. In recent days, Fine has come under pressure from Republican leaders to raise more money, and has ponied up $600,000 of his own fortune for his campaign, he told The Associated Press. Plus, outside groups are spending more than $2 million to help Fine, according to data from AdImpact, narrowing the fundraising gap. North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, acknowledged that Fine should have stepped up his fundraising earlier, but said he’ll be a strong member of Congress. “I’m not concerned about margins,” Hudson said. “I mean, special elections are special.” According to an email shared with the AP, even people in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ orbit are working to gin up support for Fine — a notable development because of the venom the two Sunshine State Republicans hold for each other, after Fine publicly turned on DeSantis to endorse Trump during the 2024 presidential primary. In a message to voters this week, a DeSantis staffer urged “grassroots warriors” to knock on doors and make phone calls in the 6th District, saying the race “is at a critical crossroads” and “the stakes couldn’t be higher.” Bryan Piligra, a spokesperson for the Fine campaign, said they appreciate the help. “The only thing that matters is making sure Republicans are united to defeat radical Democrats like Josh Weil who will stop at nothing to destroy President Trump,” Piligra said in a statement. Weil, in a statement of his own, said the “tides are turning” on the GOP as Trump pushes tofire federal workersanddismantle federal agencies. Weil said he’s grateful to those “who have invested in my campaign and made this a truly grassroots effort. It’s because of them that we have Republicans scrambling.” Still, the chair of the Republican Party of Florida, Evan Power, said he’s confident the Republican candidates will win their races because “we have the ground game.” But he acknowledged that turnout tends to fall significantly during special elections, which could cut into the GOP’s margin of victory. “Republicans haven’t done as great in special elections as they do in general elections,” Power said. Some observers say the national attention being paid to Democrats in safe Republican districts is itself a victory for the minority party. But Jewett, the political scientist, said it would take a “miracle” for Democrats to win either seat. “Money is important in elections,” Jewett said. “But it can only — usually — it can only take you so far.” Associated Press writers Leah Askarinam in Washington and Stephany Matat in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Florida’s three standout seniors and its deep bench kept bringing energy until it became too tough for Maryland’s “Crab Five” to keep up. Coach Todd Golden could see his Gators wearing the Terrapins down. Will Richard scored 15 points, Alijah Martin added 14 points and seven rebounds, and No. 1 seed Florida played a steady second half to run away from fourth-seeded Maryland and into the NCAA Tournament’s West Region final with an 87-71 win Thursday night. Walter Clayton Jr. contributed 13 points and four assists as Florida’s senior leaders and their deep supporting cast took down Maryland’s hardworking starters — one of Terrapins coach Kevin Willard’s concerns coming into this matchup. “We come in with great energy,” said Florida reserve Denzel Aberdeen, who scored 12 points in 19 minutes. “Just everybody being ready, whoever’s name is called, I think that’s what we did.” Freshman sensation Derik Queen scored 27 points to lead Maryland (27-9) in what might have been Willard’s final game guiding the program. “I think their bench really wore us down,” Willard said. Florida (33-4) advances to play Saturday against third-seeded Texas Tech,which rallied past Arkansasin overtime in Thursday’s late game at Chase Center. The Gators, in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2017 and seeking the program’s first Final Four berth since 2014, committed 13 of their 17 turnovers in the first half but took better care of the ball over the final 20 minutes. Florida already eliminated two-time defending NCAA champion UConn in the second round and is 10-1 in regional semifinals.  “The message was simple: We have to take care of the ball,” Golden, the Gators’ third-year coach, said. The “Crab Five”— featuring WNBA starAngel Reese’s brother Julian, who had his sister in the stands to cheer— roared back in the first half when it seemed Florida might pull away. Queen, who hit a buzzer-beaterin a 72-71 victory Sunday over Colorado Statein the second round, shot 8 for 17 and made all 10 of his free throws. Clayton, Martin and Richard combined for 42 points and three others scored in double figures for Florida. The senior trio had scored 56 of the Gators’ 77 points in the two-point victory against UConn last Sunday.That sent coach Golden back to the Bay Area, where he played for Saint Mary’s and coached at the University of San Francisco before taking the Florida job. Now, they get to extend their stay into the weekend. “It’s surreal, to be honest. The thing that I keep kind of going back to, selfishly, personally, I just don’t want it to end,” Golden said. “We have a uniquely tight group. ... It’s been an amazing run.” Willard’s future was unclear ashe has been linked to the Villanova joband also publicly expressed concerns last week with the direction of the Terrapins program,calling for “fundamental changes.” Fans booed the coach as the team departedits hotel earlier in the day. Golden had described the Terrapins as “freaky talented” coming into the game. Willard had compared Clayton to Stephen Curry when it comes to shooting off the dribble. Clayton had been 22 for 43 from 3-point range — 51.2% — over his five postseason tournament games coming in. He wound up 2 of 6 from deep. Maryland: The Terrapins were outrebounded 5-1 early before Reese’s offensive rebound, putback and three-point play at the 15:21 mark of the first half — and Maryland forced 10 turnovers over the opening 13:30 to get back in the game. Florida: The Southeastern Conference Tournament champion Gators used their depth to generate a 29-3 advantage in bench points, with Maryland getting its first bench point with 1:15 to play. ...Sophomore forward-center Alex Condonlimped off to the locker room with an injury to his troublesome right ankle at the 12:16 mark of the first half and underwent a precautionary X-ray, then returned with 13:29 left.

The royal family has weathered a difficult period since January 2024 when both Charles and his daughter-in-law, Kate, the Princess of Wales, were hospitalized for different medical procedures and doctors discovered they both had cancer. While Kate announced in September that she had completed chemotherapy, the king continues to receive treatment. Charles is due to resume official duties soon and plans a state visit to Italy next month. Here’s a timeline of recent events in the royal family: Charles becomes king upon the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. Charles makes first foreign visitas monarch to Germany. Thenew monarch is crownedat Westminster Abbey. Charlestravels to France for a state visit, making a stop at the fire-damaged Notre Dame cathedral. Charles makes a state visit to Kenya, expressing sorrow and regret for past violence committed against Kenyans as they sought independence. Charles attends a Christmas service at Sandringham, the royal estate in eastern England, alongside Prince William, Kate, their children and other members of the royal family. It will be Kate’s last public appearance for six months.  Kate, 42, is admitted to the London Clinic and undergoes abdominal surgery. The news isn’t announced until the next day. Kensington Palace revealsthat Kate is recovering from a planned operation. Officials say her condition isn’t cancer-related, but didn’t specify what surgery it was, only saying it was successful. They say she will remain in the private hospital for 10-14 days and be away from public view until after Easter. Buckingham Palace announces on the same day that Charles will be treated for a benign enlarged prostate. Charles is admitted to a London hospitalfor a three-day stay for his prostate treatment. Kate and Charles are both discharged from the London Clinic. Charles is photographed leaving the hospital with Camilla and waving at well-wishers. Kate isn’t pictured leaving the hospital. Buckingham Palace announces thatCharles has cancerand will receive treatment. Officials don’t say what form of cancer the king has. Prince Harryarrives in the U.K. from California to visit his father. He departs the next day. Charlescheerfully waves to well-wishersafter leaving church services near Sandringham, his first public outing since his cancer diagnosis. Kensington Palacereleases a photoof Kate surrounded by her children to mark Mother’s Day in Britain. The photo, the first official one since she underwent surgery, was retracted hours later by The Associated Press and other news agencies over concerns it had been digitally manipulated. Amid speculation about her health sparked by the edited family photo,Kate issues an apologyon social media for the “confusion” caused. She says that she “occasionally experiments with editing” like many amateur photographers. The Sun newspaperpublishes a videoreportedly showing a smiling and relaxed Kate shopping with William at a farm shop near their Windsor home. In a video address, Kate announces that she’sundergoing treatment for cancer, including chemotherapy. She says she is getting stronger every day, but needs to focus on her recovery. Buckingham Palace announcesthat Charles will return to public-facing duties. Charles attends commemorations in Normandy marking the80th anniversary of D-Day. Kate issues anupdate on her health, saying that she has “good days and bad days” and is “blown away” by the public’s support. She says that she will attend ceremonies the next day to mark the monarch’s official birthday. Kateattends the king’s official birthday ceremonies, also known as Trooping the Color, along with William, their three children and other members of the royal family. Crowds cheer when the royals emerge onto a Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a military flyby at the end of the event. Kate presents tennis player Carlos Alcarazwith his trophy at Wimbledon in her second public appearance since announcing her diagnosis. Kate releases a video message, sayingshe has finished chemotherapyand reflecting on her “complex, scary and unpredictable” cancer journey. She says she will undertake “a few more public engagements” in the coming months as she recovers. Charles and Queen Camilla complete a physically taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Charles wasbriefly hospitalizedfor observation after experiencing “temporary side effects’’ related to a scheduled cancer treatment. He waves to well-wishers in central London the following day. Charles cancels planned engagements on the advice of his doctors.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File)         University of Melbourne hydrology professor Dongryeol Ryu and his collaborator Ki-Weon Seo were on a train to visit Ryu’s family when they found something startling. Stopped at a station for technical issues, Seo had pulled out his computer to pass the time with some work when a result popped up in their data that Ryu could hardly believe: It suggested a “remarkable” amount of Earth’s water stored on land had been depleted. “At first we thought, ‘That’s an error in the model,’” Ryu said. After a year of checking, they determined it wasn’t. Their paper,published Thursday in the journal Science,finds that global warming has notably reduced the amount of water that’s being stored around the world in soil, lakes, rivers, snow and other places, with potentially irreversible impacts on agriculture and sea level rise. The researchers say the significant shift of water from land to the ocean is particularly worrisome for farming, and hope their work will strengthen efforts to reduce water overuse.

(AP Photo/Edmar Barros, File)  Earth’s soil moisture dropped by over 2,000 gigatons in roughly the last 20 years, the study says. For context, that’s more than twice Greenland’s ice loss from 2002 to 2006, the researchers noted. Meanwhile, the frequency of once-in-a-decade agricultural and ecological droughts has increased, global sea levels have risen and the Earth’s pole has shifted. Ryu and his colleagues used three different data sources to verify that Earth storing less water on land than it once did. He also said their results reveal a deeper truth about the land, one farmers have to contend with frequently: When a big, dramatic rainfall event comes after a drought, sometimes leading to huge floods, that doesn’t mean the water stored underground has recovered.  “It seems that lands lost their elasticity to recover the previous level,” he said. Fishers look for a spot to collect their catch in Cabo de la Vela, Colombia, Feb. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Ivan Valencia, File)  Whether that elasticity ever returns will depend on whether humans take action on climate change and significantly change water use, the researchers say. The increasing heat stress on plants means they need more water. Agriculture, particularly irrigated agriculture, continues to draw up more water than it can afford. And humans are continuing to emit greenhouse gases without a strong effort to reverse course. “There are long-term climate changes that have happened in the past and presumably could occur in the future that could reverse the trend described, but probably not in our lifetimes,” said Katharine Jacobs, a University of Arizona professor of environmental science who wasn’t involved in the study. “Because greenhouse gases will continue to cause global warming well into the future, the rate of evaporation and transpiration is not likely to reduce any time soon.” The study also confirms an explanation for a slight wobble in the rotation of the Earth — it’s being driven by the changing moisture levels of the planet. “When I read this thing, I was very excited,” said Luis Samaniego, a professor of hydrology and data science at the University of Potsdam who wrotean overview commentary discussing the findings in Science.“It’s a fascinating puzzle of all disciplines that came at the right moment to verify something that was not possible before.” A fisher rows his Shikara, or traditional wooden boat, on his way home during sunset at the Dal Lake, in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Feb. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File)  But Samaniego stressed that the finding isn’t only fascinating; it’s a wake-up call. Imagine the planet’s wobble like an electrocardiogram for the Earth, he said. Seeing this result is like detecting an arrhythmia. Choosing not to listen to the doctor — “that’s what we are playing around with at the moment,” he said.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Dawn Staley sent JuJu Watkins a text as soon as she saw the star Southern California sophomore suffer aseason-ending knee injuryon Monday night. It was “really tough” to see Watkins in pain, the South Carolina women’s basketball coach said. “JuJu is loved by all of us,” Staley added. Coaches and players all across women’s basketball, along with fans of the game, feel the impact of Watkins’ injury. The dominant USC guard and Associated Press All-America first-teamer will likely miss significant time, leaving the sport without one of its most transcendent stars during March Madness. How Watkins’ absence will affect the women’s Sweet 16 remains to be seen, though attendance and ratings are down from last season’s record highs for the women’s tournament that featured Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. But that shouldn’t come as surprise. After the record-setting numbers that tuned in for the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird showdown in the 1979 national championship, the ratings for the 1980 tourney signficantly dropped. “JuJu is raising our game up with how she plays,” said Staley, whose Gamecocks will face Maryland on Friday in the Sweet 16, “with pouring into marketing when it comes to NIL deals. She’s a business herself. And to see part of that not be a part of our NCAA Tournament — something is missing. There’s a big void.” In the opening two rounds of this year’s women’s tournament, there were 224,972 fans in attendance, representing a 30% decrease from last season’s record that saw 292,456 people show up. Still, this year’s mark is the third highest ever, also trailing the 231,677 that came to March Madness in 2023.  Ratings also dropped, with the first round averaging 367,000 viewers across all 32 games. That’s a 22% drop from last season. But those numbers are up 43% from the 2023 tournament, which was the second-most watched ever. “It’s a massive disappointment because she’s such an extraordinary player,” said ESPN college basketball analyst Rebecca Lobo. “People would be watching her for the first time in the regionals. It’s a huge disappointment and blow as we’ve had so much growth over last year and a half. “She’s been a big part of that.” Watkins’ knee bent awkwardly as she planted her right foot on a fast break five minutes intoUSC’s victory against Mississippi Statein the second round. She immediately grimaced and collapsed onto the court before being carried off by multiple people, unable to put any weight on her leg. USC later said she would have surgery and then rehabilitate. After the injury, many took to social media to express their heartbreak and send encouragement, includingJohnson,Reeseand Clark. “Sending all my thoughts and prayers to JuJu,”Clark postedon X. “Kid will come back stronger than ever.” Watkins had emerged as the next face of women’s college basketball after Clark raised its profile to unprecedented levels while at Iowa. The 6-foot-2 Watkins led USC to itsdeepest run in the NCAA Tournamentin over 25 years last season and was the nation’s No. 2 scorer, averaging 27.1 points. She has NIL deals with Nike, Fanatics, snack maker Mondelez, United Airlines, Degree deodorant, State Farm, Gatorade and collectibles company Funko, among others. And her NIL valuation is one of the highest in the country at an estimated $739,000, according to On3.com. Celebrities all over star-studded Los Angeles flocked to USC’s Galen Center to watch her play this season, including movie star Michael B. Jordan, rapper Snoop Dogg and Vanessa Bryant. While this year’s field is full of individual talent and numerous legitimate title contenders, many were excited to watch Watkins continue her stellar season — in which she averaged 24.6 points — and potentially lead the Trojans to their first national championship in 41 years. “My mom played basketball at Santa Clara, so I’ve kind of been tapped into the tournament,” said Claire Swendsen, 22, who is in Spokane, Washington, for the other half of the Sweet 16. “I have planned on attending one of UConn’s and one of USC’s games. This kind of puts a damper on the SC game.” There are still big names in the tournament that resonate with fans, including Connecticut senior Paige Bueckers, who also had to rebound from an ACL injury and is making her last run at a national championship. UConn’s blowout win overSouth Dakota Statewas the most-watched game of the second round, drawing an average of 1.7 million viewers to ESPN on Monday night. Watkins “will come back better and stronger,” said UCLA coach Cori Close. "" ... She’s such a fighter. She’ll be ready. That being said, I feel like it’s time for people around the country to really step up and see some of the other amazing players who are ready to shine. I am so sad that JuJu is not playing in the tournament anymore, but I am excited for other players are going to step into that spotlight.” There are many talented players in the women’s field, but few with Watkins’ star power. “What did we see last year with the epic battle with LSU and Iowa?” Lobo, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame who won an NCAA title with UConn, asked rhetorically. “We had the potential to get a similar kind of rematch in the Elite Eight of this one” with a Watkins-Bueckers matchup. “Even if both USC and UConn are there,” Lobo added, “it won’t be the same without JuJu. They are the biggest stars in women’s basketball. Missing one of them is huge.” AP Basketball Writer Doug Feinberg and AP Sports Writer Anne Peterson contributed.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)                DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump’s 25% tax on imported cars, light trucks and auto parts is likely to drive up prices at a time when many Americans already struggle to afford a new set of wheels. The tariffs will also force car companies to rethink what cars they make and where they make them.  Trump has been itching to tax foreign autos for years. In his first term, he declared auto imports a threat to national security, which gave him the authority to impose tariffs on them. On Wednesday, he went ahead and imposed the levies. They take effect midnight April 3. New vehicles are seen at an auto-processing facility at the Atlantic Terminal of the Port of Baltimore, Thursday, March 27, 2025, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)   It’s the latest in a number of auto industry maneuvers by Trump during his first weeks back in the White House. Auto companies are also navigatingthe reversal of fuel economy standards, dialeddown greenhouse gas emission standardsand ahost of electric vehicle policy rollbacks.  Some of the details of Trump’s auto tariffs have yet to be worked out.  For example, it’s unclear whether the new auto tariffs would stack on top of 25% import taxes set to be levied next week on all goods from Canada and Mexico. That would mean cars from Canada and Mexico could potentially face new tariffs of 50%.  And for now, the Trump administration is exempting from the tariffs cars, light trucks and auto parts that qualify for duty-free treatment under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a regional trade pact the president negotiated five years ago. Trump intends to narrow that exemption to content made in the United States, not Canada or Mexico. But that will require setting up processes to determine what qualifies as U.S.-made — something that could take weeks or months.  The White House also said the import tax would apply to “key’’ auto parts, including engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components. And it could expand the tariffs to other auto parts “if necessary.’’  Here’s what else to know:    An aerial view shows auto dealerships in Cerritos, Calif., Thursday, March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)   As automakers expanded globally, they created complicated and efficient supply chains that spanned countries. In North America, for instance, Mexico supplies low-wage labor and makes smaller, less expensive cars and trucks while Canada and the United States provide more skilled labor and technological know-how.  Trump’s tariffs are intended to bring auto manufacturing back to the United States. But it won’t be easy.  Rerouting the sourcing of thousands of parts that are imported to the U.S. and uprooting assembly operations would take years.  “It adds to the uncertainty facing all automakers as the industry’s supply chain is inherently global and has optimized around moving components across national borders where free trade agreements have existed in the past,” said John Paul MacDuffie, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania.  Sam Fiorani, analyst at AutoForecast Solutions, notes that while European makers of luxury vehicles and their buyers can afford some price adjustments, “it’s the companies like Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru who import large percentages of their fleets that will take a beating.”  “Throwing tariffs on the parts of vehicles built in Mexico and Canada that aren’t sourced from the United States will hurt the profits of General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford over the next few quarters, costing them billions,” he added. Two people shop at a Toyota dealership in El Monte, Calif., Thursday, March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)   Trump’s tariffs — which he insists are permanent — will force companies to make hard choices.  “It’s going to have the effect of forcing companies to increase U.S. content’’ if they want to dodge the import taxes, said Richard Mojica, a trade attorney with Miller & Chevalier.  And even though Vanessa Miller, chair of the automotive team at the law firm Foley & Lardner, acknowledges that some companies will be able to pivot operations to the U.S., others are too tied to factories in Mexico or elsewhere to make the move anytime soon.   President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, March 26, 2025. (Pool via AP)   Automakers might have to stop making some vehicles because they won’t be profitable with the tariffs in place. The tariffs hit “everyone in a manner that makes them rethink everything,’’ said Ivan Drury of the automotive website Edmunds. “This is around at least three or four years. We’re not looking at something you can just ride out.’’    Beata Caranci and Andrew Foran of TD Economics estimate that the tariffs could raise the average price of cars and light trucks in the United States — which totaled more than $47,000 last month — by up to $5,000 if automakers pass along the entire cost to consumers. That price hike could go higher – to as much as $10,000 – if the Trump administration applies the tax full to cars made in Mexico and Canada.  Automakers and their suppliers are only now recovering fromyears of instabilitybrought on by pandemic-forced production halts, asweeping semiconductor shortageand low inventory on dealership lots. That meantprices were sky-high, incentives were low and few deals were to be had.  During the peak of the pandemic, consumers still bought vehicles at high prices. But the piled-on tariffs could put new vehicles out of reach for many would-be buyers, especially given rising indications of potentiallybroader inflation ahead throughout the economy.  “Starting almost immediately, consumers will see their already expensive new vehicles cost hundreds to thousands more and those prices will escalate even more when the supplies of many key vehicles dwindle,” Fiorani said. “Imagine the price rises during the semiconductor shortage and stretch it out across every brand and manufacturer. The trickle-down effect will put smaller suppliers out of business and send many workers onto unemployment.”        By raising new vehicle prices, tariffs will likely send buyers to the used market. But with limited used inventory, an influx of buyers could rock used car prices, too. And they already average $25,000.  Lease penetration, or the number of vehicle transactions that are leases, has averaged around 30% or so over the past 10 years, according to Edmunds data. New automobiles are loaded at the Port Newark Container Terminal in Newark, N.J., on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)   But the industry saw low rates of leasing — nearly half the norm — particularly between May 2022 and January 2023. Fewer leased vehicles typically means fewer two- or three-year-old vehicles being put on the used-car market.  So there is likely to be a shortage of used cars just as more buyers start shopping for them.    Governor Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents U.S. automakers, said that manufacturers supported Trump’s efforts to boost domestic auto manufacturing. But he cautioned that “it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector.  The United Auto Workers labor union applauded the tariffs. “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S.”  But Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, which represents international auto manufacturers, denounced the tariffs: “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S.”   Wiseman reported from Washington.

Several protesters and police officers were injured in the clashes. The Home Ministry said an injured protester died while getting treatment at a hospital, while a local TV station said one of its staff was killed when a building he was filming from was set on fire. The government imposed a curfew in the areas where the clashes happened in Kathmandu after the police in riot gear used tear gas, batons and water canon against the protesters. Thousands of supporters of former king Gyanendra Shah had gathered at the eastern edge ofKathmandufor the rally organized by an alliance of groups supporting the ex-monarch. The gathering near the airport had been planned as a peaceful rally, but trouble began when some protesters in a white pickup drove at a police barricade, colliding with several officers. Police responded by shooting tear gas shells and spraying the crowd with water canon. On the other side of the capital, thousands of people who support the present republican system of government gathered Friday for a counter rally. The rally participants were from the opposition parties led by the Maoists, a group that fought an armed rebellion from 1996-2006 to oust the monarchy.  “It is impossible for the monarchy to come back. It is ridiculous to even think that something that is already dead and cremated could come back to life,” said Ram Kumar Shrestha, a Maoist supporter. There has been growing demand in recent months for Shah to be reinstated as king and Hinduism to be brought back as a state religion. Royalist groups accuse the country’s major political parties of corruption and failed governance and say people are frustrated with politicians. “We need the country to return to monarchy and the king to come back, because the political parties and system have failed in the country,” said Rajendra Bahadur Khati, one of the participants at the pro-monarchy rally. “When the source is so polluted the entire system has gotten rotten.” Massive street protests in 2006 forced Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule, and two years later the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy. Gyanendra, who left the Royal Palace to live as commoner, has not commented on the calls for the return of monarchy. Despite growing support, the former king has little chance of immediately returning to power.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP) — Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday clarified his reasons for visiting Wisconsin two days ahead of its hotly contestedSupreme Court electionafter deleting a social media post saying he planned to “personally hand over” $2 million to a pair of voters who havealready cast their ballotsin the race. Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be “spokesmen” for an online petition against “activist” judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition. The change in direction came amid calls for an investigation into whether Musk’s actions were a felony under Wisconsin law, which prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for a vote. Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later. He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election that will determine ideological control of the court in the battleground state. “I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,” Musk’s now deleted post said. “This is super important.”  The Supreme Court race has shattered previous spending records for a U.S. judicial election and has becomea referendum on Musk and the first monthsof President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night. “It’s a very important race,” Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel’s campaign. “I know you feel it’s local, but it’s not. It’s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.” Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday’s election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play. Musk’s political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against “activist” judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and “get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.” “If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,” Ainsworth said in the video. Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel’s campaign this year, campaign finance records show. Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk’s political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday. Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did. That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote. Any legal challenge to Musk’s payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition. The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery. Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment. Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV. “I, frankly, thought, ‘Should I sign that petition? I’m against activist judges, but I don’t think I should do that,’” Schimel said. When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, “I don’t know what the criteria to get it was.” Crawford’s campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk’s announced visit to Wisconsin a “last-minute desperate distraction.” “Wisconsinites don’t want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk’s lackey Brad Schimel,” he said. Musk’s political action committee useda nearly identical tacticbefore the White House election last year,offering to pay$1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. During last year’s presidential race, Philadelphia’s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutorsfailed to showthe effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day. Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million. Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state. Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given thatTesla’s lawsuitcould end up before the justices. The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule onabortion rights,congressional redistricting,union powerand voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point. More than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)         Supporters of Palestinian causes with ties to American universities have been detained in the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. President Donald Trump and other officials have accused protesters and others of being “pro-Hamas,” referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Many protesters have said they were speaking out against Israel’s actions in the war against Hamas in Gaza. More than half a dozen people are known to have been taken into custody or deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in recent weeks. Federal officersdetained 30-year-old Turkish studentRumeysa Ozturk on Tuesday as she walked along a street in suburban Boston. A seniorDepartment of Homeland Securityspokesperson said without providing evidence that an investigation found Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” a U.S.-designated terrorist group. Friends and colleagues of Ozturk said her only known activism was co-authoring an op-ed in a student newspaper that called on Tufts University to engage with student demands to cut ties with Israel. Ozturk has been taken to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. A U.S. District judge has given the government until Friday to explain why Ozturk is being detained. This month, immigration enforcement agentsarrested and detainedMahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident and Palestinian activist who was prominent inprotestsat Columbia last year. The administration has said it revoked Khalil’s green card because his role in the campus protests amounted to antisemitic support for Hamas. He is fighting deportation. Khalil served as anegotiator for Columbia studentsas they bargained with university officials over ending their campus encampment last spring. He was born in Syria but is a legal U.S. resident married to an American citizen. Yunseo Chung is a Columbia student and lawful U.S. resident who moved to America from Korea as a child. Chung attended and was arrested at asit-in this month at nearby Barnard Collegeprotesting the expulsion of students who participated in pro-Palestinian activism. The Department of Homeland Security wants to deport Chung and has said she “engaged in concerning conduct,” including being arrested on a misdemeanor charge. A judgeordered immigration agents not to detain Chungwhile her legal challenge is pending. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar from India, was arrested outside his Virginia home anddetained by masked Homeland Security agentson allegations that he spread Hamas propaganda. Suri’s attorney wrote in a court filing that he was targeted because of his social media posts and his wife’s “identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.” Suri holds a visa authorizing him to be in the U.S. as a visiting scholar, and his wife is a U.S. citizen, according to court documents. Suri was taken to a detention facility in Louisiana, according to a government website. His lawyers are seeking his immediate release and to halt deportation proceedings. Leqaa Kordia, a resident of Newark, New Jersey, was detained and accused of failing to leave the U.S. after her student visa expired. Federal authorities said Kordia is a Palestinian from the West Bank and that she was arrested at or near Columbia during pro-Palestinian protests. Columbia has said it has no record of her being a student there. Kordia is being held in an immigration detention center in Alvarado, Texas, according to a government database. Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and doctoral student at Columbia, fled the U.S. after immigration agents searched for her at her university residence. The Trump administration has said it revoked Srinivasan’s visa for “advocating for violence and terrorism.” Srinivasan opted to“self-deport.” Officials didn’t say what evidence they have that Srinivasan advocated violence. Her lawyers deny the accusations, and shetold The New York Timesthat she didn’t help to organize protests at Columbia. University of Alabama student Alireza Doroudiwas detained by ICE on Tuesday, the university confirmed. The Crimson White, the student newspaper, said Doroudi was detained, but neither the university nor the newspaper explained why he is in ICE custody. David Rozas, a lawyer representing Doroudi, said in an email that Doroudi is being detained in Alabama but he believes Doroudi will be moved to an immigration facility in Jena, Louisiana. Doroudi is a doctoral student from Iran studying mechanical engineering, Rozas said. Doroudi said he isn’t aware of any suspected criminal activity or violations of his lawful status. Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist from Lebanon who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island, was deported this month, even though a federal judge ordered that she not be removed until a hearing could be held. Homeland Security officials saidAlawieh was deportedas soon as she returned to the U.S. from Lebanon, despite having a U.S. visa, because she “openly admitted” supporting formerHezbollah leaderHassan Nasrallah. Alawieh told officers she followed him for his religious and spiritual teachings and not his politics, court documents said. She was to start work at Brown University as an assistant professor of medicine. Stephanie Marzouk, Alawieh’s lawyer, has said she will fight to get the 34-year-old doctor back to the U.S. Momodou Taal is a doctoral student at Cornell University whose visa was revoked after he participated in campus demonstrations. Taal, a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia, has asked a federal judge to halt his detention during his court challenge. The government says it revoked Taal’s student visa because of his alleged involvement in “disruptive protests.” His attorneys say the 31-year-old doctoral student in Africana studies was exercising free speech rights. Taal said he will surrender to immigration authorities if the court determines the government is acting legally. Taal said in a court declaration that “I feel like a prisoner already, although all I have done is exercise my rights.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Allison Joyce)                     A largewildfirein the South Carolina mountains has doubled in size on each of the last three days. But fire crews have been able to keep the blaze away from structures. Firefighters battling theTable Rock Mountain firehave concentrated on saving lives and property by digging fire breaks that push the blaze north through undeveloped land on the Pickens County ridges near the North Carolina state line, officials said Friday. No injuries have been reported. Airplanes and helicopters have completed more than 550 water-dropping missions on the Table Rock fire and a second blaze on Persimmon Ridge about 8 miles (13 kilometers) away. But for now it ismostly defensein the Blue Ridge Mountains until the weather cooperates with a soaking rain or lessening winds, South Carolina Forester Scott Phillips said at a news conference Friday at Table Rock State Park. “With these fires and the conditions we are facing in the state right now — the dryness of the fuel, the extremely low humidity, the high winds that we’re having — containment is very, very difficult to achieve,” Phillips said. The Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires have burned about 17 square miles (44 square kilometers). The Table Rock fire started a week ago and has been doubling in size since Tuesday as windy and dry conditions have spread through the mountains. InNorth Carolina, at least eight fires were burning in the mountains. The largest — the Black Cove Fire and the Deep Woods Fire in Polk County — were becoming more contained. They have scorched about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) combined but have barely grown late this week.  And while those fires have received the most attention, the wildfire season has already been busy thanks to a drought andHurricane Helenesix months ago knocking down millions of trees. Thefallen treesact as fuel and block firefighters trying to get to blazes. “It will be a continuing issue for the next several years. It’s going to change the way we have to attack fires in the mountains of South Carolina,” Phillips said. Firefighters helping the state Forestry Commission have fought 373 wildfires in South Carolina that have burned more than 28 square miles (73 squarer kilometers) just in March. “That’s orders of magnitude more than we typically do within a month –- even more than we do in some years as far as the number of acres burned,” Phillips said. April is typically the worst month for wildfires and long-term forecasts don’t show conditions changing much. “This is going to be a long season for us,” Phillips said. A ban an outdoor burning has been in place for more than a week in South Carolina. Officials have given no indication when they will lift it. Gov. Henry McMaster reminded people that violating the burn ban can mean jail time, and starting a fire even through negligence could leave someone on the hook for everything damaged. “You go out and start a fire and you burn your neighbor’s house down –- you owe them a house,” McMaster said. Weather forecasts for the weekend have encouraging news. Calm winds are predicted overnight, and rain should fall Sunday and Monday, although the National Weather Service is not predicting the kind of soaking firefighters want. “We’re going to get it out,” McMaster said of the fires. “We’re hoping we are going to have some rain, have some help. Everybody put that in your prayers.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Javier Arciga)        ATLANTA (AP) — Black women around the world gather in salons, dorm rooms and living rooms for hours at a time to get synthetic braids put in their hair. But they’re wondering if the convenience and fashion benefits are being outweighed bypotential health hazards. The question circulating on social media and in the Black community follows on the heels of a proposed federal rule — that’s still in limbo after multiple delays — to ban thecarcinogen formaldehydein hair-straightening chemicals. There’s a thin body of research into the potential issues of using synthetic hair for braids. The latest addition is an independent study from Consumer Reports into chemicals found in braiding products. Some say the findings are concerning, but others are hesitant to make recommendations in part because the methodology did not go through a typical study review process. All of the experts who spoke with The Associated Press did agree more research is needed into synthetic braids and other products Black women often use in or on their hair. Here’s a look at what’s known, what’s not known and what you might want to do in the meantime. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on using synthetic hair for braiding.  Experts say it’s difficult to draw conclusions from prior studies. The Consumer Reports study, which was published in late February, said there were dangerous chemicals like lead, benzene and other carcinogens in 10 of the most popular synthetic braiding products. While experts said the presence of the chemicals is concerning and confusing, they noted the study didn’t go through the rigorous scrutiny that it takes to get published in a peer-reviewed science or medical journal. Javon Ford, a cosmetic chemist who talks about his work on social media, questioned the report’s findings, saying “the data set is so limited.” Consumer Reports only sampled two of each product, despite thousands on the market. James Rogers, the head of product safety at Consumer Reports who led the study, said his hope was to get the information out there because of the lack of research. He noted that it was a pilot project, but that “we thought the results were important enough to start the conversation.” Research published in 2020 in the journal Environmental Health Insights showed synthetic hair let off volatile organic compounds — chemicals that can easily evaporate into the air — when heated. Synthetic hair is sealed when braided, either by burning it or dipping it in hot water. That study detected many of the same chemicals named in the Consumer Reports study, like the known carcinogen benzene. Experts can’t answer whether the products are truly safe — but that’s because there’s so little research out there. There’s also little government oversight on the products, which leaves manufacturers to ensure that they’re safe. Consumer Reports is petitioning the Food and Drug Administration to begin regulating synthetic braiding hair. Jasmine McDonald, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who has studied the health impacts of chemical hair straighteners, said the Consumer Reports study shouldn’t invoke fear but awareness about the potential harms of braiding hair, the lack of federal regulations and the minimal research. “I think that in our culture, we sometimes normalize things to the point where we don’t see the harm ... the more that we can raise awareness that some of these cultural routines could potentially provide harm is us having the potential to stop that harm,” McDonald said. If you’re concerned about using synthetic braiding hair or straightening chemicals, there are other hairstyles to try. You can use Brazilian wool hair instead of synthetic hair, said Gloria Okpurukre, who owns Anointed Fingers braiding salon in Fayetteville, Georgia. You can also braid your real hair, but don’t expect the same results. “The purpose of adding the hair is for volume and length,” Okpurukre said. “A lot of people, their hair starts thinning out and they need to add something to make it look nice.” Some synthetic brands use banana fiber to create the hair, which companies say are less irritating to the scalp. But Ford said you won’t necessarily avoid chemicals just because you switch brands. Raven Baxter, a molecular biologist who has talked about braiding hair on social media, opted to stop using synthetic braiding products because of the lack of information — both on the packaging or in research studies. Now, she uses single-ingredient products in her hair care routine, like aloe vera gel and vegetable glycerin. “A lot of the work that scientists do, we’re able to do it because a funder deemed it as important to support that research,” she said, adding, “until we have funders that value the things that we’re concerned about, we’re not necessarily going to get the research published that concerns us.” McDonald suggested staying away from products that contain PFAS, parabens and other “forever chemicals.” She also said consumers can determine what’s in the products and their relative safety by looking at online databases, like the Breast Cancer Prevention Partners’ Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.

All Rights Reserved. CAIRO (AP) — You wouldn’t think that someone who goes around banging a drum in the streets before dawn and waking up the whole neighborhood would be so beloved.  But many children and families love the “musaharati,” or “dawn caller,” a traditional fixture of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month when the faithful fast from dawn to sunset. It’s his job to wake people up in time to have a meal before the daily fast begins.

He evokes the homey, communal feeling that the holy month brings for many, the feeling that everyone is facing the hunger of the day’s fast together — and enjoying the night’s meals together.  Often the job of musaharati is passed from father to son. So everybody in the neighborhood knows him, and he knows them.

Technology is destroying our history and causing us to lose our identity,” said Fanas, who owns a toy store. He wanted to preserve the tradition of his father, “and God willing, my children will preserve it too.”  “The most beautiful thing is when I see the children happy to see me,” he said.

(Kirill Zykov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)                              MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that President Donald Trump’s push for control overGreenlandwasn’t surprising given longtime U.S. interest in the mineral-rich territory. Speaking at a policy forum in the Artic port of Murmansk, Putin noted that the United States first considered plans to win control over Greenland in the 19th century, and then offered to buy it from Denmark after World War II. “It can look surprising only at first glance and it would be wrong to believe that this is some sort of extravagant talk by the current U.S. administration,” Putin said. “It’s obvious that the United States will continue to systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic.” Trump irkedmuch of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Fridayon a trip that was scaled backafter an uproar by Greenlanders and Danes. Speaking on Thursday, Putin noted that Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening itsmilitary capabilityin the polar region.  “We are certainly concerned about NATO members describing the Far North as the region of possible conflicts,” he said, noting that Russia’s neighbors Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance. “Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernizing military infrastructure.” Russia has sought to assert its influence over wide areas of the Arctic in competition with the United States, Canada, Denmark and Norway as shrinking polar ice from the warming planet offers new opportunities for resources and shipping routes. China also has shown an increasing interest in the region, believed to hold up to one-fourth of the Earth’s undiscovered oil and gas. “We won’t allow any infringement on our country’s sovereignty, reliably safeguard our national interests while supporting peace and stability in the polar region,” Putin said. While pledging to strengthen Russia’s military foothold in the Arctic, Putin said that Moscow was holding the door open to broader international cooperation in the region. “The stronger our positions will be, the more significant the results will be and the broader opportunities we will have to launch international projects in the Arctic involving the countries that are friendly to us, and, possibly, Western countries if they show interest in joint work. I’m sure the time will come to launch such projects.” Kirill Dmitriev,head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Putin’s envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S. officials, told reporters last month that Russia and the U.S. should develop joint energy ventures. “We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions,” he said.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                               LOS ANGELES (AP) — When filmmaker Travis Gutiérrez Senger reflects on ASCO’s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence onChicano art history. “That movement continues today, and it’s very expansive,” he says. “There’s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.” He’s referring to “ASCO: Without Permission,” a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herrón III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group “asco” — “nausea” or “disgust” in Spanish — after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles. All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way. “To behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,” said executive producer Gael García Bernal at the film’sSouth by Southwest film festivalpremiere earlier this month. “You’re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.”  Bernal and Diego Lunaexecutive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution. Patssi Valdez, a founding member of the Chicano art collective ASCO (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Gutiérrez Senger’s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO’s early rebellion. “I felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,” said Gamboa. Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding. “For the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn’t happened before,” she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators. ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid theEast LA walkouts, protesting education inequality,and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality. Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities. “The response to such violence was to create art,” said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints. For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet. “I couldn’t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,” said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled “Instant Mural,” a metaphor on feeling captive. One of ASCO’s most known works is “Spray Paint LACMA.” Gamboa, Gronk and Herrón spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, “Chicanos are in gangs, they don’t make art.” Harry Gamboa Jr., a founding member of the Chicano art collective ASCO (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  “There was another era when people said, ‘Latinx art, you know, doesn’t exist. It’s not a thing. It doesn’t belong. It’s not part of American art,’” said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of theLucas Museum of Narrative Art. ASCO’s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In “Station of the Cross,” the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War. In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media’s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story. ASCO’s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted “ASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,” the first retrospective to present the group’s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment. “Latino history has always been erased,” said Gutiérrez Senger. “‘ASCO: Without Permission’ is a story of winning a battle, not a war.” A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards — a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on thelack of Latino representation in Hollywood. The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member. “Hollywood movies, rock ’n’ roll. That’s what I was about,” said Valdez. “And that’s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.” Gamboa photographed Herrón, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called “No Movies” and later inspired their satirical award show. Gutiérrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists — including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha — in short films inspired by ASCO’s signature DIY style. “I think it’s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you’re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,” said Gutiérrez Senger. “We have rich stories, and we have a rich history.” Travis Gutiérrez Senger’s latest documentary, “ASCO: Without Permission” chronicles the story of a 1970s Chicano art group named “asco.” Their name translates to “nausea” or “disgust” in Spanish. ASCO used their conceptual work and performance art to speak of issues related to the Chicano civil rights movement. (March 27) “ASCO: Without Permission” includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, includingactor Michael Peñaandcomedian Arturo Castro,who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history. “Our history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we’ve had are not in the history books,” Peña says in the documentary. Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and “misbehave and not ask for permission.” “You do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,” said Gamboa. “And the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Finding health advice on social media is easier than knowing which claims to trust,https://apnews.com/article/wellness-advice-social-media-influencers-supplements-cf040ff9a3f2f3d8e759a8333747fa91,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File)       In the corners of social media dominated by wellness content, influencers recommend an assortment of treatments and products to support weight loss, fight exhaustion or promote other desired health outcomes. Some of the endorsed approaches may be helpful. Many play into fads with scant evidence to back up enthusiasts’ claims, medical experts say. Some influencers encourage their followers to avoid specific food items, such asseed oils, while others advocate going all in on certain foods, such as the meat-heavy carnivore diet. There are video pitches for berberine, a chemical compound that’s been touted online as “nature’s Ozempic,” and for non-medical IV vitamin therapy, which businesses popularly known as drip bars market as cures for hangovers or fatigue. To be sure, alternative health practices and cures that lacked the medical establishment’s backing were a part of popular culture long before the internet age. But the plethora of advice shared online has both prompted calls for safeguards and found a measure ofmainstream acceptance. The new U.S. health secretary,Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had hisInstagram account suspendedin 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr.Mehmet Ozaccused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia’s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app. With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online: Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don’t necessarily mean content creators don’t believe in what they’re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work. Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it’s therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the “buy” button, whether it’s for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed. Researchpublished last monthin the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with “some form of financial interest” in promoting the screenings. After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to “mention important harms, including overdiagnosis” resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels. Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as “the backbone” of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue. “It’s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it’s a red flag,” he said. “I don’t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.” In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers. “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is,” Bryant said. Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it’s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices. In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database. The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct. If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations. Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency’s interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed. In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted “sugar-containing products” and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians. If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it’s best to check and see if what they’re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus. “Just because somebody has an ‘M.D.’ after their name doesn’t make them entirely trustworthy,” said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology. Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they’ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review. In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.

(AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis) VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis offered prayers to the victims of apowerful earthquakein Southeast Asia on Friday, the sixth day of his convalescence in the Vatican after a five-week hospitalization for life-threatening double pneumonia. “The pope has been informed of the disaster in Myanmar and is praying for the dramatic situation and for the many victims, also in Thailand,’’ the Vatican said. Images showed widespread destruction inMyanmar’s second-largest cityfrom the 7.7 magnitude quake centered in a country embroiled by civil war, which also rocked neighboring Thailand. Sincereturning to the Vaticanon Sunday, the pope has continued physical and respiratory therapy, with slight improvements in both his speaking and movements, the Vatican said without providing further details. He continues to be treated for a lingering fungal infection of the respiratory airways. The pontiffappeared weak and frailwhen he greeted the faithful from a balcony of the Gemelli Hospital last Sunday. He was later seen in the front seat of his white Fiat 500L wearing nasal tubes to receive supplemental oxygen. At the Vatican, Francis is receiving oxygen around the clock, with high-pressure delivery through nasal tubes only for part of the night. He can go without for short periods if an activity requires it, Vatican sources said. He has received no outside visitors since returning to his residence in the Domus Santa Marta, and is surrounded by his medical team and close collaborators. He spends his time resting, in prayer and continuing the work of his papacy, the Vatican said.  Doctors have said he needs to spend at least two months of rest and recovery, avoiding large gatherings, after the respiratory illness that included two serious crises that brought him near death. The doctor who coordinated his hospital treatment, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, said this week that the medical team brieflyconsidered stopping treatmentafter a Feb. 28 respiratory crisis, before deciding on an aggressive course that eventually beat the double pneumonia. The Vatican has not yet commented on whether he will participate in any Holy Week celebrations including Easter on April 20, or the April 27canonization of Carlo Acutis, who will be the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint. King Charles III’s audience with Francis planned for April 8 waspostponed by mutual agreement. The Vatican No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, met Friday with Polish President Andrzej Duda on the 20th anniversary of the death of St. John Paul II — a meeting originally planned with the pope. The two also discussed thewar in Ukraine, and security and peace in Europe, the Vatican said in a statement.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Trevor Wilson/U.S. Army via AP)                             WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. and Lithuanian troops and authorities are struggling to drain a swampy area in Lithuania in an ongoing effort to recover four American Army soldiers who went missing three days ago. The soldiers’ armored vehicle was discovered submerged in 15 feet of water and so far teams have been unable to get inside or pull it out. U.S. Army Europe and Africa said Friday that cranes, a large-capacity pump and more than 30 tons of gravel have been brought in to help drain the water, dig out the mud and pull the M88 Hercules out of the swamp. They warn that this will be a long operation. In a statement, the Army said that the area around the site is “incredibly wet and marshy and doesn’t support the weight of the equipment needed for the recovery of the 70-ton vehicle without significant engineering improvements. Draining the area has been slow and difficult due to ground water seepage.” The four soldiers, whose identities have not been released, went missing early on Tuesday when they were on a mission to recover another Army vehicle during unit training. The Hercules was found on Wednesday, and teams have been working since then to get the vehicle out. The soldiers are part of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. A U.S. Navy dive crew is being brought in, and the Polish Armed Forces have volunteered to send engineers, additional equipment and 150 personnel to also assist.  “This will be a long and difficult recovery operation, but we are absolutely committed to bringing our soldiers home,” said Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, commander of 1st Armored Division. “I remain incredibly impressed by the discipline, commitment and comradery in this unit as they attempt to recover their missing comrades.” The soldiers were reported missing during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town less than 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border with Belarus.

All Rights Reserved. The New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Another wipeout is slamming Wall Street Friday as worries build about a potentiallytoxic mixofworsening inflationand a U.S. economy slowing because ofhouseholds afraidto spend due to theglobal trade war. The S&P 500 was down 2% in afternoon trading and on track for one of its worst days of the last two years. It’s also heading for itsfifth losing weekin thelast sixafter wiping out whatits big gain from the start of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 732 points, or 1.7%, as of 1:45 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.7% lower. Lululemon Athletica dropped 15% to lead the market lower, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year, in part because “consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,” said CEO Calvin McDonald. Inflation news send stocks lower. Here’s AP business correspondent Seth Sutel. Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 4.4%. CEO Tom Chubb said it saw a “deterioration in consumer sentiment that also weighed on demand” beginning in January, which accelerated into February. They’re discouraging data points when one of the mainworries hitting Wall Streetis thatPresident Donald Trump’sescalatingtariffsmay cause U.S. households and businesses tofreeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurtthe economy.  A report on Friday morning showed all types of U.S. consumers are getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three in a survey by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That’s the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that’s been thelinchpinkeeping the U.S. economy solid. Another report released in the morning raised concerns after it showed a widely followed, underlying measure of inflation was a touch worse last month than economists expected. The data followed reports on other measures of inflation for the month, but this is the one the Federal Reserve tracks most closely as it decides what to do with interest rates. The report also showed that an underlying measure of how much income Americans are making, which excludes government social benefits and some other items, “has been treading water for the last three months,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Households aren’t in a good place to absorb a little tariff pain,” Jacobsen said. “The Fed isn’t likely to run to the rescue either as inflation moved up more than expected in February.” The Fed has been keeping its main interest rate on hold this year after cutting it sharply in late 2024, in part because of worries about inflation remaining above its 2% target. While more cuts to rates would give the economy and financial markets a boost, they would also push upward on inflation. The economy and job market have so far been holding up relatively well, but if they were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called “stagflation.” Policy makers in Washington have few good tools to fix it. Some of Wall Street’s sharpest losses on Friday hit companies that need customers feeling confident enough to spend, and not just on yoga wear or beach clothes. Delta Air Lines lost 5.2%. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean Group fell 4.9%. Casino operator Caesars Entertainment dropped 4.3%. The heaviest weights on the market were Microsoft and other Big Tech stocks, whose massive sizes give their movements more sway over indexes. They and other stocks that had gotten caught up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology have been leading the way lower in Wall Street’s recent sell-off. Their prices had shot up so much more quickly than their already fast-growing revenues and profits that critics said they looked too expensive. CoreWeave, whose cloud platform helps customers manage complex AI infrastructure, fell 3% in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq. It’s potentially another signal of waning excitement about AI. On the flip side, among the relatively few rising stocks on Wall Street were those that can make money almost regardless of what the economy does, such as utilities. American Water Works rose 2.4%, for example. Stock markets worldwide will likely remain shaky as an April 2 deadline approaches for more tariffs. That’s what Trump has called “Liberation Day,” when he will roll out tariffs tailored to the United States’ trading partners. In each case, he said the “reciprocal” tariff will match the burden the other country places on the United States, including things like value-added taxes. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell sharply in Japan and South Korea as auto makers felt more pressure following Trump’s announcement he plans to impose 25% tariffs onauto imports. Hyundai Motor fell 2.6% in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6%, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8% in Tokyo. On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.8%, and General Motors sank 1.9%. EvenU.S. automakersselling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States. Thailand’s SET lost 1% after apowerful earthquakecentered in Myanmar rattled the region, causing the prime minister to declare a state of emergency for the capital, Bangkok. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 4.25% from 4.38% late Thursday. It tends to fall when expectations for either U.S. economic growth or inflation are on the wane.

Chinese researchers report a pig kidney transplant and a first-step liver experiment,https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-liver-organ-xenotransplant-china-b0bbc05b80bc7abed7dc7c0cdcf3a0e5,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A miniature pig waits for visitors to feed it at a zoo in Shanghai, China, on Thursday Feb. 15, 2007. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the questfor animal-to-human organ transplants– with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too. A Chinese patient is thethirdperson in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person. Scientists aregenetically altering pigsso their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. —two pig heartsandtwo pig kidneys– were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving – anAlabama womantransplanted in November and aNew Hampshire mantransplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin. Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient “is very well” and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi’an told reporters in a briefing this week. Wang, part of the hospital’s xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago. But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation — learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin — important for basic organ function — although not as much as human livers do.  The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting. “We do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,” Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver. In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of “bridge” supportby externally attaching a pig liverto a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach. In China, Wang’s team didn’t remove the deceased person’s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it. That “clouds the picture,” said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn’t involved with the work. “It’s hopefully a first step but it’s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.” Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome. According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it’s unclear how that experiment turned out.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, stands for a portrait at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, March 16, 2023. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via AP, File)     After Chief Justice John Robertsrebuked callsthis week by the Trump administration to impeach judges, social media users falsely claimed that he and other high-level legal professionals are part of a “secretive, invite only club.” Many questioned the motives of members, hinting at coordinated efforts to oppose President Donald Trump. Among those named was U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who Trump had demanded be removed from the bench for his order blocking deportation flights that the president was carrying out by invokingwartime authoritiesfrom 18th century law. But the group in question — the American Inns of Court — is hardly secretive given its large public presence, and there is no evidence that members are involved in nefarious activities targeting Trump. Roberts is no longer an active member and Boasberg is the president of a chapter that is no longer affiliated with the parent association. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Roberts, Boasberg and other powerful legal professionals are part of a secret, invite-only club that is working against Trump. THE FACTS: This is false. Roberts was a member of the Edward Coke Appellate Inn of Court chapter of the organization prior to his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005, but he is not currently an active member of the organization, according to Executive Director Malinda Dunn. Boasbergis the presidentof the Edward Bennett Williams Inn of Court, but the chapter disaffiliated from the parent association about 10 years ago when it decided it no longer wanted to pay dues to the national group, Dunn said. He was an active member prior to the chapter’s decision to operate independently.  Information on the American Inns of Court isreadily availableonline. Chapters also have their own websites, which often include details about programs they host for members, typically focused on networking, education and mentorship. Dunn said that members have a wide range of political opinions, but that the organization itself is “assiduously apolitical.” Some on social media, however, baselessly claimed that there is more to the group than meets the eye. “It has been revealed that Chief Justice John Roberts is part of an elite, invite-only group called the American Inns of Court, alongside some of the most openly anti-Trump judges in D.C.,” reads one X post. And yet a check of other members reveals a diverse group. Many current and former Supreme Court justices have been members of the American Inns of Court, according to Dunn, including Sandra Day O’Connor, Neil Gorsuch, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Clarence Thomas. Inns of Court have existed in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years. The American system, founded in 1980 out of discussions among legal professionals, including Chief Justice Warren Burger, is loosely based on this concept from across the pond. The American Inns of Court stateson its websitethat it is “dedicated to professionalism, ethics, civility, and excellence” and that its mission is to “inspire the legal community to advance the rule of law by achieving the highest level of professionalism through example, education, and mentoring.” O’Connor said in a2015 videothat “maintaining and improving an ethics of professionalism is what the American Inns of Court are all about.” There are more than 300 active chapters across the U.S. Each one manages its own membership and some are limited to practitioners in a certain legal field. Roberts’ former chapter, for example,states that“members are elected to the Inn after being nominated by a current member” and that they must be “actively engaged in appellate practice.” Dunn said chapters are advised to ensure that their members include legal professionals with different levels of experience. Some may hold membership drives to recruit new faces. Roberts is currently anhonorary bencherin The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, an inn of court in the U.K. This is a purely ceremonial role that, according to Dunn. British inns of court will always offer such a position to Supreme Court justices when they are confirmed, she said. Representatives for Roberts and Boasberg did not respond to a request for comment.

FILE 0-Rob Gronkowski, wearing a wrestling championship belt, makes an appearance at Gronk Beach music festival during Super Bowl week on Saturday, Feb. 11, 2023, at Talking Stick Resort in Scottsdale, Ariz. (Photo by Mark Peterman/Invision/AP, File) Rob Gronkowski grew up emulating his sports heroes in school, never shy about unleashing a Stone Cold Stunner or dropping a People’s Elbow on his roughhousing friends. Yes, he pulled his punches a bit just like the real stars — Gronkowski rattled off wrestling favorites ranging from Val Venis to the bad boys ofDegeneration X— but there was nothing phony about his love of WWE. “We just loved what the WWE brought to our childhood,” the retired New England Patriots tight end said. “The characters. It wasn’t even about the fights in the ring. It was how awesome these guys as personalities were.” Gronk grew into one of the most supersized characters of ’em all. So it was of little surprise that the fun-loving, fearless Gronkowski’scharisma and hulking musclesmade him a natural fit as a WWE star. Hehosted WrestleManiain 2020. He was provoked intojumping the railand hit the ring at another WrestleMania after bad guy Jinder Mahal tossed a drink in his face. And yes, four Super Bowl rings are nice, but how many NFL stars can claim they were WWE 24/7 champion like Gronkowski? Gronkowski successfully won the only wrestling title that had the caveat of being defended against anyone, anywhere, any time. He would lose the championship after he was pinned in a backyard. Gronkowski is tag-team partners again with WWE, this year bringing the “Gronk Beach” parties he threw at the Super Bowl to WrestleMania next month in Las Vegas. WrestleMania has soared for decades as a sport-entertainment attraction — last year’s event in Philadelphia boasted close to 150,000 fans over two nights at the home of the Eagles — and will debut “WrestleMania After Dark” for the April 19 and 20 dates. Gronkowski will throw his party after Sunday night’s show.  “WrestleMania gets the same amount of people as the Super Bowl and they don’t have all those parties that surround it like the Super Bowl does,” Gronkowski said. “It was such a good idea to bring Gronk Beach to WrestleMania because of that reason.” While pro wrestling is built on the swerve — the art of delivering fans the unexpected — Gronkowski said he would not compete at WrestleMania, citing his brother’s wedding on that Saturday night. “I will not be in the ring at WrestleMania,” he said. “I really wish I could possibly do something.” “Gronk Beach” at Fontainebleau Las Vegas advertised performances by rappers such as Flo Rida and appearances from WWE stars such as Damian Priest and Tiffany Stratton. Oh, there’s a standing invite for his old Patriots coach, Bill Belichick to crash the party. “That invite will always be there,” Gronkowski said. “Him and his girlfriend, the doors are wide open. He doesn’t have to pay for a ticket. He’ll full exclusive VIP.” Belichick, in his first season at North Carolina, knows his way around a beach. Belichick and his 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson shared snaps on Instagram of the couple doing yoga on a Florida beach. Belichick has turned into a bit of a media darling andsocial media sensationsince his split with the New England Patriots. He clowns around and offers insights on “The Pat McAfee Show” and even needled his former players at Tom Brady’s Netflix roast. “I’m all in for it. I’m a big fan of it,” Gronkowski said. “It all started at the roast. The way he came out firing at his players. All of his ex-players in New England. It just was fun, come out, see him crack some jokes, show that personality that he truly has.” AP sports:https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Robert Willett/The News & Observer via AP, File)     WASHINGTON (AP) — A judge challenging the outcome of his North Carolina Supreme Court race was photographed wearing Confederate military garb and posing before a Confederate battle flag when he was a member of a college fraternity that glorified the pre-Civil War South.  The emergence of the photographs comes at a delicate time for Jefferson Griffin, a Republican appellate judge who is seeking a spot on North Carolina’s highest court. Griffin, 44, is facing mounting criticism – including from some Republicans – as he seeks toinvalidate over 60,000 votes cast in last November’s election, a still undecided contest in which he is trailing the Democratic incumbent by over 700 votes. Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for the N.C. Supreme Court listens to testimony in Wake County Superior Court on Friday, February 7, 2025 in Raleigh, N.C. (Robert Willett/The News & Observer via AP, File)   The photographs, which were obtained by The Associated Press, are from when Griffin was a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1999-2003 and amember of the Kappa Alpha Order, one of the oldest and largest fraternities in the U.S., with tens of thousands of alumni.  Griffin said he regretted donning the Confederate uniform, which was customary during the fraternity’s annual “Old South” ball.  “I attended a college fraternity event that, in hindsight, was inappropriate and does not reflect the person I am today,” Griffin said in a statement. “At that time, like many college students, I did not fully grasp such participation’s broader historical and social implications. Since then, I have grown, learned, and dedicated myself to values that promote unity, inclusivity, and respect for all people.”   One of the pictures, taken during the 2001 ball, shows Griffin and roughly two-dozen other fraternity members clad in Confederate uniforms. Another photograph from the spring of 2000 shows Griffin and other Kappa Alpha brothers in front of a large Confederate flag. He served in 2002 as his chapter’s president.      Kappa Alpha has proven to be a lightning rod for controversy over the decades, often due to the racist or insensitive actions of some of its members. A number of politicians have been forced to apologize for having worn Confederate costumes at the fraternity’s functions or for being photographed in front of a Confederate flag.  Jesse Lyons, a spokesman for the fraternity’s national office in Lexington, Virginia, said use of the rebel battle flag was prohibited in 2001 and displaying other Confederate symbols had been discouraged years before. The fraternity banned the wearing of the Confederate uniforms in 2010. It’s unclear if the chapter at UNC banned the uniforms before the national organization did.  “We believe in cultural humility, we respect the best parts of our organization’s history, and through education we challenge our members to work for a better future. These things are not mutually exclusive,” Lyons said. Have a news tip?

Lee as its “spiritual founder” and long championed the Southern “Lost Cause,” a revisionist view of history that romanticizes the Confederacy and portrays the Civil War as a valiant struggle for “states’ rights” unrelated to the enslavement of Black people. In decades past, some Kappa Alpha chapters referred to themselves as a “klan,” a term that many viewed as an unsubtle wink to the Ku Klux Klan.  The photographs featuring Griffin were taken at a time when many other Kappa Alpha chapters were reevaluating their celebration of the Confederacy.  During Griffin’s time in the fraternity, some in his chapter questioned the appropriateness of dressing up in Confederate uniforms for the ball. Griffin opposed abandoning the tradition, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. The uniforms stayed.  Griffin said he would “not respond to unsubstantiated comments based on memories of 20-plus years past.”  In high school Griffin also expressed an affinity for Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who led southern forces during the Civil War. In a 1998 feature on high school “scholars of the week” in The News & Observer of Raleigh newspaper, Griffin said Lee was his No. 1 choice to include on an “ideal guest list” for a party.      The Kappa Alpha Order was founded in 1865, not long after Lee surrendered to the Union Army, at a Virginia college where Lee served as president. At least one of the first members was a former rebel soldier who had served under Lee, who is revered by the fraternity as the ideal of gentlemanly Southern chivalry.  For more than a century, Kappa Alpha threw “Old South” parties. They were formal affairs where the Confederate battle flag was flown and fraternity brothers dressed in replica Confederate gray uniforms and their dates wore antebellum-style hoop skirts. Sometimes they would ride through campus on horseback.  Some Kappa Alpha chapters, particularly in the South, clung to their traditions, including the wearing of blackface, even as they drew protests and public sentiment shifted.  A Kappa Alpha “Old South” parade at Alabama’s Auburn University in 1992 drew supporters waving Confederate battle flags, as well as counter protesters who burned them. In 1995, a group of Kappa Alpha members at the University of Memphis hurled racial slurs while beating a Black student who caused a disturbance outside a frat party, the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported at the time.  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was no exception to the turmoil. Under pressure from student group’s, the school’s Kappa Alpha chapter in 1985 canceled its annual “Sharecropper’s Ball,” which some attended in blackface. Fraternity members said blackface was worn because the event needed both Black and white attendees, but promised to discontinue the practice, according to a news story in the Daily Tar Heel student newspaper.  The Kappa Alpha chapter at North Carolina’s Wake Forest University stopped allowing members to wear Confederate uniform and display the Confederate flag in 1987.  But other chapters held on longer. It wasn’t until Kappa Alpha members at the University of Alabama wore Confederate uniforms during a parade that paused in front of a Black sorority, which elicited intense blowback, that the national headquarters forbade them.    Griffin is not the first public official to draw unwanted attention for their college-age embrace of symbols drawn from the darker chapters of the South’s past.  Virginia’s then-governor, Democrat Ralph Northam,came under intense criticism in 2019over a racist photo that appeared on his yearbook page of his medical school. The incident led reporters to scour the college histories of other Southern leaders, forcing a number of politicians to publicly address their time as Kappa Alpha brothers.  Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, then the state’s Republican lieutenant governor,dodged questions in 2019 about photos showing him wearing a Confederate uniformwhile he was a Kappa Alpha member at Millsaps College in the early 1990s. While Reeves was enrolled there in October 1994, other members of the fraternity were disciplined for wearing afro wigs and Confederate battle flags and shouting racial slurs at Black students, the AP reported at the time.  Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMasterdeclined to commentafter yearbooks listed him as the leader of the fraternity’s chapter at the University of South Carolina in 1969, along with photos of members wearing Confederate uniforms and posing with a rebel flag.

(AP Photo/Hassan Ammar)             BEIRUT (AP) — An alreadyfragile ceasefirebetween Israel and the Lebanesemilitant group Hezbollahappeared to be on shaky ground Friday after rockets fired from Lebanon into northern Israeltriggered Israeli airstrikesin the suburbs of Beirut. The rocket launch from Lebanon was the second in a week, after a lull since December. In both cases, Hezbollah denied being behind the attacks. The Israeli military has continued tostrike regularly in southern Lebanon, but Friday was the first time it hit the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire deal brokered by the U.S. and France brought an end to the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. The exchange highlighted the tenuous nature of the deal and worried residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs and border communities in Israel, many of whom only recently returned to their homes after being displaced during the war. Here are details of the ceasefire deal and a look at how Friday’s blowup might affect it.  Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day afterits ally Hamaslaunched adeadly attack into Israelthat ignitedthe war in Gaza. Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling, and the two sides were locked in a low-level conflict for nearly a year. In September 2024, the exchange of fire escalatedinto a full-scale war. Israel launched widespread aerial bombardment of the country and a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. More than 4,000 people were killed in Lebanon, including much of Hezbollah’s top leadership but also hundreds of civilians. The internationally brokered dealthat ended the war called forboth Hezbollah and Israeli forces to withdrawfrom the area south of the Litani River in Lebanon, which would be patrolled by a beefed-up Lebanese army, along with U.N. peacekeepers. The agreement called for Lebanese authorities to prevent Hezbollah and other armed groups from launching attacks on Israel and for Israel to halt “offensive military operations” in Lebanon. However, the deal allows both sides to act in “self defense” without defining what that means. It also left vague how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying that Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river. While the ceasefireended the all-out war, it did not end the conflict altogether. Israel has launched regular airstrikes in southern Lebanon since the agreement took effect, saying that it istargeting Hezbollah facilities and officialsto prevent the group from rearming. The initial deadline for Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon was in late January, but it was later extended to Feb. 18. When Israel did not withdraw from border villages by the original deadline, hundreds of demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter the villages, and Israeli troops opened fire, killing more than 20 people. After Feb. 18, Israeli forces withdrew from most of the border area but continued to occupy five strategic overlook points in southern Lebanon, saying that the military needed to maintain a presence there to protect border villages in northern Israel. Lebanese officials have called for a full withdrawal. The U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL said in a statement Friday that it has tracked more than 650 “trajectories” fired across the border since the ceasefire agreement took hold, with “the vast majority” of them traveling from Israel to Lebanon. It also reported more than 30 airstrikes in southern Lebanon and nearly 1,200 “activities” by Israeli ground troops. Hezbollah has announced only one strike on Israel since the ceasefire took effect, when it fired rockets into the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights in December. Hezbollah denied responsibility for this week’s launches into Israel — both of which were shot down — and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon. Some in Lebanon theorized that the launches were carried out by armed Palestinian factions, particularly since the launch pads discovered by the Lebanese army appeared to be primitive. But some analysts took the militant group’s denial with a grain of salt. Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank, said it is unlikely that the launches could have taken place without Hezbollah’s blessing. “At the end of the day, who’s active in southern Lebanon?” he said. Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Middle East programs, said the missiles could have been an authorized action by Hezbollah or the result of “an external actor who decided to make a point.” They could also have been an unauthorized action by “local Hezbollah guys who were upset at the fact that the leadership has been very passive” in the face of the Israeli attacks in Lebanon since the ceasefire, he said. Before and after the rare strike in Beirut, Israel hammered southern Lebanon with airstrikes, and officials said it would continue to do so. “We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a trickle,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “We will attack everywhere in Lebanon, against any threat to the state of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely.” Without peace in the northern Israel area of the Galilee, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, “there will be no peace in Beirut.” Hage Ali said Israel has been emboldened by the “carte blanche” it has received from the Trump administration to strike when and where it pleases in Lebanon despite the ceasefire. Hezbollah, meanwhile, does not appear to be in a position to return to sustained fighting. “Its deterrence is gone. The Israelis are not scared of Hezbollah anymore,” Blanford said. “This is the big change between before October 2023 and now.” But Hage Ali said that if Israel continues to take an aggressive stance in Lebanon, it could eventually backfire and “at some point, we’re going to see an implosion of the ceasefire.” Associated Press Writer Julia Frankel in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

Apart from eggs, potatoes and some bread, it’s empty because state electricity in Syria only comes two hours a day. “We can’t leave our food in the fridge because it will spoil,” she said. Her husband, a taxi driver in Damascus, is struggling to make ends meet, so the family can’t afford to install a solar panel in their two-room apartment in Jaramana on the outskirts of the capital. Months after a lightning insurgencyended over half a century of the Assad dynasty’s rule in Syria, the Islamist interim government has been struggling to fix battered infrastructure after a 14-year conflict decimated much of the country. Severe electricity shortages continue to plague the war-torn country.

Millions of Syrians, like Al-Ahmad and her family, can’t afford to pay hefty fees for private generator services or install solar panels. Syria’s new authorities underinterim leader Ahmad Al-Sharaahave tried to ease the country’s electricity crisis, but have been unable to stop the outages with patchwork solutions. Even with a recent gas deal with Qatar and an agreement with Kurdish-led authorities that will give them access to Syria’s oil fields, the country spends most of its days with virtually no power. Reports of oil shipments coming from Russia, a key military and political ally of Assad, shows the desperation.

It’s just enough that her children can huddle in the living room to finish their homework after school. And the family is not alone.

But the new interim authorities have scrambled to establish control across the country and convince Western nations to lift economic sanctions to make its economy viable again. The United States in Januaryeased some restrictionsfor six months, authorizing some energy-related transactions. But it doesn’t appear to have made a significant difference on the ground just yet. Washington and other Western governments face a delicate balance with Syria’s new authorities, and appear to be keen on lifting restrictions only if the war-torn country’s political transition is democratic and inclusive of Syrian civil society, women and non-Sunni Muslim communities. Some minority groups have been concerned about the new authorities, especially incidents of revenge attacks targeting the Alawite community during acounter-offensiveagainst an insurgency of Assad loyalists. Fixing Syria’s damaged power plants and oil fields takes time, so Damascus is racing to get as much fuel as it can to produce more energy.

(AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad)  Damascus is now looking towards the northeastern provinces, where its oil fields under Kurdish-led authorities are to boost its capacity, especially afterreaching a landmark ceasefire dealwith them. Political economist Karam Shaar said 85% of the country’s oil production is based in those areas, and Syria once exported crude oil in exchange for refined oil to boost local production, though the fields are battered and bruised from years of conflict. These crucial oil fields fell into the hands of the extremist Islamic State group, which carved out a so-called caliphate across large swaths of Syria and Iraq from 2014 to 2017. “It’s during that period where much of the damage to the (oil) sector happened,” said Shaar, highlighting intense airstrikes and fighting against the group by a U.S.-led international coalition.

The new authorities hope to resolve this in a landmark deal with the SDF signed earlier this month. Kamran Omar, who oversees oil production in the Rmeilan oil fields in the northeastern city of Hassakeh, says shortages in equipment and supplies and clashes that persisted with Turkey and Turkish-backed forces have slowed down production, but told the AP that some of that production will eventually go to households and factories in other parts of Syria. The fields only produce a fraction of what they once did. The Rmeilan field sends just 15,000 of the approximately 100,000 barrels they produce to other parts of Syria to ease some of the burden on the state. The authorities in Damascus also hope that a recent deal with Qatar that would supply them with gas through Jordan to a major plant south of the capital will be the first of more agreements.

Moscow once aided Assad in the conflict against armed Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that toppled the former president, but this shows that they are willing to stock up on fuel from whoever is offering. Interim Electricity Minister Omar Shaqrouq admitted in a news conference that bringing back electricity to Syrian homes 24 hours a day is not on the horizon. “It will soon be four hours, but maybe some more in the coming days.” Smoke rises from a tank used as makeshift refinery on the outskirts of Qamishli, northeast Syria, Saturday, March 22, 2025, where oil is refined into gasoline and other products like diesel.

(AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad)  Increasing that supply will be critical for the battered country, which hopes to ease the economic woes of millions and bring about calm and stability. Shaar, who has visited and met with Syria’s new authorities, says that the focus on trying to bring fuel in the absence of funding for major infrastructural overhauls is the best Damascus can do given how critical the situation is. “Electricity is the cornerstone of economic recovery,” said Shaar. “Without electricity you can’t have a productive sector, (or any) meaningful industries.” Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

(South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File)           COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina death row inmate on Friday chose execution byfiring squad, just five weeks after the state carried out its first death by bullets. Mikal Mahdi, who pleaded guilty to murder for killing a police officer in 2004, is scheduled to be executed April 11. Mahdi, 41, had the choice of dying by firing squad, lethal injection or the electric chair. He will be the first inmate to be executed in the state sinceBrad Sigmonchose to be shot to death on March 7. A doctor pronounced Sigmon dead less than three minutes after three bullets tore into his heart. “Faced with barbaric and inhumane choices, Mikal Mahdi has chosen the lesser of three evils,” one of his lawyers, David Weiss, said in a statement. “Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney.” Mahdi ambushed Orangeburg public safety officer James Myers at the officer’s shed in Calhoun County in July 2004. Myers had just returned from an out-of-town birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said. Myers’ wife found his burned body, shot at least eight times including twice in the head, in the shed that had been the backdrop for their wedding less than 15 months earlier, authorities said. Mahdi will be strapped to a chair 15 feet (4.6 meters) from three prison employees who volunteered to be on the firing squad. A target will be placed on his chest. Their rifles will all be loaded with a live round that shatters when it hits his rib cage.  Aside from Sigmon, only three other U.S. inmates — all in Utah — have been killed by a firing squad in the past 50 years. Sigmon was the first inmate killed by bullets in the U.S. since 2010. Mahdi’s lawyers have fileda final appealwith the state’s highest court, saying Mahdi’s case for a life sentence at his original trial took only 30 minutes and that his lawyers failed to call anyone who could testify on his behalf. It “didn’t even span the length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,” they said. Several defense lawyer organizations have filed briefs saying no one should be executed after such little effort to defend them. Mahdi’s lawyers said that as a juvenile Mahdi spent months in isolation in prison and that this altered his developing brain and affected his judgement. After Mahdi pleaded guilty to murder, Judge Clifton Newman said he sentenced the young man to death because a sense of humanity he tried to find in every defendant seemed not to exist in Mahdi. Prosecutors responded to the claim of a poor defense by saying Mahdi was able to present much more evidence during a 2011 appeal that had to be heard inside a prison because Mahdi had stabbed a death row guard during in an escape attempt. A judge rejected the appeal. “In Mahdi’s vernacular, if his mitigation presentation before Judge Newman ‘didn’t even span the length of a Law & Order episode,’ the review of any potential error is in its 24th season,” the state Attorney General’s Office wrote in court papers. Prosecutors said a lot of the new evidence would help Mahdi’s case, including a string of attacks and threats on prison employees; his guilty plea to killing a convenience store clerk in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, before the South Carolina killing; and two other deaths that authorities in Virginia think he may be connected to. “The nature of the man is violence,” prosecutors wrote. Mahdi has one more opportunity to live — he can ask Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life in prison without parole just minutes before his scheduled execution at 6 p.m. on April 11 at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. But no South Carolina governor hasoffered clemencyin the 47 executions in the state since the death penalty resumed in the U.S. in 1976. In the past seven months, South Carolina has executedFreddie Owenson Sept. 20;Richard Mooreon Nov. 1;Marion Bowman Jr.on Jan. 31; and Sigmon.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Greg Baker/Pool Photo via AP)                     BEIJING (AP) — France’s foreign affairs minister said Friday that France and China are making progress toward resolving a trade dispute over cognac imports. Jean-Noel Barrot said the conclusions of a Chinese investigation that could potentially lead to the permanent implementation of provisional customs duties on European cognac imports have been delayed by three months, until June. “We’ll be really pleased when the problem is behind us. And it’s clear that, step by step, we’re moving towards a resolution,” Barrot said. Chinaannounced last year provisional tariffsof 30.6% to 39% on Remy Martin and other European brandies after a majority of European Union countriesapproved duties on electric vehiclesmade in China. The brandy tariffs are provisional and require importers to make a deposit with the Chinese customs agency for the amount of the tariff. The move followed a preliminary finding by China’s Commerce Ministry that European brandy was being dumped in China, threatening “substantial damage” to domestic producers. “The risk faced by the industry until yesterday was that definitive application would be made at the end of the investigation period,” Barrot said. “Following this visit, I received confirmation that the investigation has been postponed by three months, which rules out the scenario of a sudden application of definitive duties on this sector.” According to the sector, China is the largest consumer market for cognac by value. Experts said the imposition of definitive duties would affect 70,000 direct and indirect jobs, 270 cognac houses, and 4,400 winegrowers.  China has opened a series of anti-dumping investigations into European brandy,porkanddairy products. The brandy probe was the first and targeted mainly French makers of cognac and similar spirits such as Armagnac. Barrot said the investigation will be closed after three months, and that the Chinese authorities will make decisions based on the results. “Everyone will continue to work together to put this dispute behind us so that we can move forward on a sound basis,” he said. French President Emmanuel Macronpresented Chinese leader Xi Jinping with two bottles of cognacwhen the two exchanged gifts during Xi’s state visit to France last year.

(City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)           The city ofSt. Augustine— with its centuries-old buildings and massive stone fort — is an enduring reminder of Spain’s storied history in Florida, going back generations before the United States even existed. But for two decades in the 1700s, Great Britain controlled the region, and archeologists have finally found some of their long-sought-after footprints. City archeologists identified a dry moat last fall of a British redoubt, a fortified military outpost, that had been constructed in 1781. Excavations were completed last month in the city’s Lincolnville neighborhood, making way for the construction of a new single-family home. “St. Augustine had a 20-year British period,” city archeologist Andrea White said. “They came, and they built seven of these redoubts, and nobody has ever found any archeologically. We have rough ideas of where they were, and they show up on historic maps. But we’ve never found actual, tangible, archeological evidence for any of them until recently.” The Spanish military built theCastillo de San Marcosin the late 1600s, and the fort remains on the western shore of Florida’s Matanzas Bay, though as a national monument rather than a military installation. When the British took control of Florida in 1763, St. Augustine already had extensive Spanish-built defenses, but British officers were concerned about an attack from a nearby river and ordered the construction of the outposts along the city’s western edge.  White said Britain’s relatively brief occupation of St. Augustine, which ended along with the American Revolution in 1783, has been largely forgotten by time, and the discovery of the fort is a way to reclaim a little piece of lost history. “That’s what’s interesting about these British redoubts, they’re the only defenses that the British built themselves,” White said. “Everything else that’s in St. Augustine or the surrounding area that everyone’s familiar with, those were already built by the Spanish. And then the British just kind of reoccupied them.” The structure was discovered thanks to a unique archeological preservation ordinance adopted by St. Augustine in 1986, White said. Founded in 1565, the city is the oldest continuously occupied part of the U.S. to previously be a European settlement. To document and preserve that history, St. Augustine has its own archeology program that is part of the city’s planning and permitting department. “We get a chance to come in and document what’s there prior to construction,” White said. “We never stop construction, that’s not the goal. It’s just to give us a little bit of time to come in, document what might be there, learn a little bit more about our history, and then the project gets to move forward.” White knew the area under development had a long history, going back to a Native American mission in the early 1700s, followed later by an agricultural plantation and after the Civil War, the construction of the Lincolnville neighborhood. “So we knew we had multiple centuries of history that could potentially be on the property, but we’re pretty excited to actually find evidence,” White said. “What we found evidence of was a large moat about 15 feet wide that would have been part of the rampart.” Researchers found few artifacts at the site and are still unsure about the fort’s actual size and shape, but they did recover thousands of different types of seeds. White said they’re working with a paleoethnobotanist, who studies the history of how humans and plants interact, to learn how the structure was built and used. It’s possible that plants like Spanish bayonet or prickly pear cactuses were used to prevent erosion or to slow down attacking soldiers. “So we’re very hopeful that we might find some good information from our plant remains that we’ve recovered,” White said. Jason Heidgerken, the contractor working on the lot where the fort’s moat was found, said the city’s archeological program can certainly cause delays, but White and her team were great and communicating well, so he could adjust his timelines. “I’ve been around St. Augustine since 1980 personally, and part of the attraction is the history,” Heidgerken said. “So if you want to live there and do this kind of business, it’s to be expected, and you need to have the patience for it.” Over the past four decades, the city’s archeology program has completed more than 1,200 projects. Not only have researchers collected data fromSpanish colonial timesbut also Native American settlements and villages going back 4,000 years. “I actually think it’s pretty cool what the city does. I’m a history nut myself,” Heidgerken said. “I think it’s pretty neat.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Kate Payne)           WASHINGTON (AP) — Tuesday’sspecial electionsto replace Florida’s Republican former U.S. Reps. Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz will be held in two of the state’s GOP strongholds, but Democrats hope thatstrong fundraisingin both districts is an indicator the races will be more competitive than they were in the last election just five months ago. Control of the U.S. House is not at stake, but the outcome of the special elections could give congressional Republicans some breathing room in the narrowly divided chamber. Republicans hold 218 seats, the minimum needed for a majority in a fully seated House. Democrats hold 213 seats, with two additional vacant seats most recently held by Democratic lawmakers. In the 1st Congressional District, Republican Jimmy Patronis and Democrat Gay Valimont are running to replace Gaetz. Patronis is the state’s chief financial officer. He received President Donald Trump’s endorsement in thecrowded 10-person primary. Valimont is a gun control activist. She challenged Gaetz for the seat in November and received 34% of the vote. In Waltz’s old 6th Congressional District, the candidates are Republican state Sen. Randy Fine and Democrat Josh Weil, a public school educator in Osceola County. Fine represents a Brevard County-based state Senate district located outside the boundaries of the Palm Coast-area U.S. House seat he hopes to fill. He won three-way primary on Jan. 28 with Trump’s endorsement. The 1st Congressional District borders Alabama on the Gulf Coast in the westernmost part of the Florida panhandle. It is home to both Naval Air Station Pensacola and Eglin Air Force Base. The district is among the most reliably Republican areas of the state. Trump received about 68% of the district vote in 2024, slightly outperforming the 66% Gaetz received in his reelection bid.  The four counties that make up the 1st District have voted for Republican presidential candidates almost continually for the past 60 years. Only Walton County went for a Democrat on one occasion since 1960, although all four voted for Democrat-turned-independent candidate George Wallace in 1968. Today, the part of Walton County that falls within the 1st District is the most reliably Republican of the four counties. Escambia is the least Republican in comparison, although Trump and Gaetz still received 59% and 57% of the county vote, respectively. On the other side of the state, the 6th Congressional District sits on the Atlantic Coast and includes Daytona Beach. Republican presidential candidates have carried all six counties in the district for the last four presidential elections. The Republican winning streak in some of the counties stretches back for decades before that. Lake County, for instance, hasn’t supported a Democrat for president since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. Trump carried the district in 2024 with 65% of the vote. Waltz received about 67% of the vote in his final House reelection bid. Trump and Waltz performed best in Putnam County, where they both received about 74% of the vote. Their worst county in comparison was Volusia, where Trump received 58% and Waltz received about 60%. Waltz slightly outperformed Trump in every county in the district. Gaetz resigned from Congress afterTrump nominated himto be attorney general, but he laterwithdrew from considerationfollowing ongoing scrutiny overa federal sex trafficking probeanda House Ethics Committee investigation. Waltz resigned in January to becomeWhite House national security adviser. This week, Washington was roiled by the news that Waltz had added a journalist toa Signal app group chat discussing military plans. Waltz, according to The Atlantic, appeared to have mistakenly added the journalist to a chat that included 18 senior Trump administration officials discussing planning for a strike in Yemen, but many Republicans going to the polls to replace Waltz have brushed off the story. The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. Machine recounts in Florida are automatic if the vote margin is 0.5% of the total vote or less. If the machine recount results in a vote margin of 0.25% of the total vote or less, a manual recount of overvotes and undervotes is required. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome. Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday: The special elections in Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 7 p.m. local time, which is 7 p.m. ET in the 6th District and 8 p.m. ET in the 1st District. The Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners in the 1st and 6th Congressional District special elections. Special primaries for state Senate and state House will also be on the ballot in some parts of Florida, but the AP will not be tabulating those contests. Any voters registered in the 1st and 6th Congressional Districts may vote in the special election in their district. As of March 3, Florida’s 1st Congressional District had nearly 566,000 active registered voters, about 55% Republicans and 21% Democrats. The 6th District had about 559,000 active registered voters, about 49% Republicans and 26% Democrats. Turnout in the Jan. 28 special congressional primaries was about 17% of registered Republicans in the 1st District and about 15% in the 6th District. Democrats did not have competitive primaries in those districts. Voter participation tends to be much higher in presidential general elections than in elections held at other times. In the 2024 general election, turnout was about 76% of registered voters in the 1st District and about 80% in the 6th District. About 73% of voters from counties that make up the 1st and 6th Districts cast their ballots before Election Day in the 2024 general election. In the 2022 general election, about 56% of voters from counties included in the 1st District voted before Election Day, compared with about 60% for voters from counties in the 6th District. As of Thursday morning, about 53,000 ballots had been cast in the 1st District, about 52% from Republicans and about 35% from Democrats. In the 6th district, nearly 71,000 had been cast, about 45% from Republicans and 40% from Democrats. In the 2024 general election, the AP first reported results in the 6th Congressional District at 7 p.m. ET, just as polls closed. The last vote update of the night was at 11:48 p.m. ET, with about 99% of the vote counted. In the 1st Congressional District, the first batch of votes was reported at 8:01 p.m. ET, or one minute after polls closed. The election night tabulation in the 1st District ended at 1:33 a.m. ET with about 99% of total votes counted. In the Jan. 28 special primaries, the first results in the 6th District posted at 7:02 p.m. ET. The final update of the night was available at 8:38 p.m. ET with more than 99% of the vote reporting. In the 1st District, the AP’s first vote results posted at 8 p.m. ET, with more that 99% of the vote reported by the time vote tabulation concluded for the night at 10:16 p.m. ET.

Janet Mills attends an event, March 11, 2022, in Augusta, Maine. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)       PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The administration of President Donald Trump is investigating Maine with a claim that dozens of school districts in the state violate federal law by withholding information about students’ gender transitioning from parents. The U.S. Department of Education said it launched the investigation on Friday, the day after it began a similar investigation into theCalifornia Department of Education. In both cases, the federal education department said the states might be violating the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act. The federal department said in a letter to the Maine Department of Education that it is investigating to determine if the agency “played a role, either directly or indirectly” in districts’ adoption of policies that withhold student records from parents. It’s the latest round in an ongoing dispute between Maine and the Trump administration about the role of transgender students in school and in high school sports. Representatives for the Maine Department of Education and Maine attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment Friday. The federal Education Department said in a statement it has heard reports that some Maine districts have policies that allow schools to “create ‘gender plans’ supporting a student’s ‘transgender identity’,” and then claim those plans are not education records and not accessible to parents. “Parents and guardians have the right to access their child’s education records to guide and safeguard their child’s mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Any policy to the contrary is both illegal and immoral,” said U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who heads a department Trump hopes todismantle.  The Trump administration began investigating Maine’s handling of the issue of transgender students in school after apublic disputebetween Trump and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in February. During a meeting of governors at the White House, Trump threatened to pull funding from Maine if the state doesn’t comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports. Mills, who was in attendance, responded: “We’ll see you in court.” The federal government then began investigating Maine’s compliance with the Title IX antidiscrimination law. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services saidearlier this monththat the Maine Department of Education as well as the Maine Principals’ Association and a Portland-area high school are in violation of Title IX. The principals’ association and high school said this week they won’t comply with a proposed agreement to bar transgender athletes from girls’ sports. The Maine education department declined to comment on the proposal on Thursday.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
Sewage sludge can find a second life on farm fields. Here’s how it’s made,https://apnews.com/article/human-waste-sewage-sludge-farm-fertilizer-how-it-works-05d3656b76223b54b3e14fe0831dd875,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. What goes down your toilet can end up on farm fields across the United States.  Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.  But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. Arecent studyreleased by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.  The amount of these “forever chemicals” that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.  “They are very widespread,” said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they’re not in all biosolids and sometimes it’s only in small amounts, he added.   At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.    After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.     The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.    The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.    After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’sregulations for land-applied biosolids.  “There are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,” including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.    Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.  The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what’s in the water. In addition to human waste, biosolids might contain all kinds of everyday household chemicals like beauty products and pharmaceuticals, some of which may contain forever chemicals, Prasse added. At the Columbus facility, the majority of their waste comes from households and businesses.  The Columbus facility tests the final product for metals and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen every month even when they are being stored before land application.    In Columbus, the city takes half of these dirt-like biosolids to a composting facility nearby, where they are mixed with other organic material like trees and leaves and turned into compost after an additional round of heating and aeration to further kill off pathogens. These biosolids are less regulated and can be used on land such as parks or a residential yard.  The Columbus facility, like most such operations, doesn’t test the incoming material for PFAS, an expensive proposition. Dixon said any future testing or treatment of wastewater for PFAS at his facility would depend on future federal regulations.  ——  Follow Joshua A.

US consumers remained cautious about spending last month as inflation ticked higher,https://apnews.com/article/economy-consumer-spending-tariffs-c8be092ecf06a81ad79c4c8f921c7cbe,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Unsold 2025 Countryman utility vehicles sit on display at a Mini dealership Sunday, March 23, 2025, in Highlands Ranch, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation picked up last month and consumers barely raised their spending, signs that the economy was already cooling even beforemost tariffswere imposed. Friday’sreportfrom the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices increased 2.5% in February from a year earlier, matching January’s annual pace. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.8% compared with a year ago, higher than January’s figure of 2.7%. Economists watch core prices because they are typically a better guide of where inflation is headed. The core index has barely changed in the past year. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, making it difficult for the central bank to cut its key interest rateanytime soon. The report also showed that consumer spending rebounded last month after falling by the most in four years in January. Yet much of the additional spending reflected price increases, with inflation-adjusted spending barely rising. The weak figure suggests growth is rapidly slowing in the first three months of this year as consumers and businesses turn cautious amid sharp changes in government policies. “Inflation too hot and spending too cold,” said Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm, in an email. “The Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates this year.” Brown estimates that economic growth could fall to zero in the first three months of this year,down from 2.4%in last year’s fourth quarter.  Inflation remains a top economic concern for most Americans, even as it has fallen sharply from its 2022 peak. Donald Trump rode dissatisfaction with higher prices to the presidency and promised to quickly bring down inflation, but the yearly rate is higher now than in September, when it briefly touched 2.1%. Consumer spending rose 0.4% in February, though the gain was just 0.1% after adjusting for prices. The mild increase follows a sharp 0.6% drop in January. The spending and inflation figures steepened a market downturn early Friday. The broad S&P 500 stock market index fell 1.4%. The Dow Jones index fell more than 500 points and the Nasdaq fell as well. The spending increase was driven by greater purchases of long-lasting goods, such as cars and appliances, which could reflect an effort by shoppers to buy things before tariffs are imposed. They are the kind of purchases that won’t likely be repeated in coming months. Spending on services, including discretionary spending such as at restaurants and hotels, fell. “The fact that consumers chose to increase outlays on goods that are about to see price increases at the expense of the far more economically important service sector provides insight into the mindset of the consumer,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at tax and advisory firm RSM. Also Friday, the University of Michigan released itsupdated consumer sentiment surveyfor March, which showed a sharp drop in Americans’ outlook for the economy. The survey also found growing anxiety over inflation and jobs. “This month’s decline reflects a clear consensus across all demographic and political affiliations,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey. “Republicans joined independents and Democrats in expressing worsening expectations since February for their personal finances, business conditions, unemployment, and inflation.” Trump has slapped 20%tariffs on all Chinese imports, 25% import taxes on steel and aluminum, and on Wednesday said he would hit imported cars with another 25% duty. Most economists, and the Federal Reserve, now expect inflation to tick higher this year as a result of the tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week said elevated inflation from the tariffscould be temporary. But he also added the outlook was unusually uncertain given the swift changes in policy from the White House. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% in February from the previous month, the same as in January, while core prices increased 0.4%, the largest increase in more than a year. Increases at that pace, for a full year, would drive inflation far above the Fed’s 2% target. One bright spot in the report was a big jump in incomes for the second straight month — they rose 0.8% in February from January. Higher income with weaker spending pushed up the savings rate, which can fuel future spending. But it also could reflect greater caution among consumers. “Savings went up, consistent with reports of flagging consumer confidence, rising uncertainty about the future and reduced expectations for the future,” Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said. Consumer and business confidence in the economy has fallen sharply since Trump began rolling out tariffs, and a measure of Americans’ outlook for the future of the economy dropped to a12-year low on Tuesday.Many polls find that most of the public sees the economy as fair or poor. A survey last month by the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Americans still see inflation as a “very big problem.” Apparel company Lululemon on Thursday became the latest retailer to warn that slumping consumer confidence will hurt sales, while the parent company of Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Johnny Was stores said that sales slowed to start the year as consumer sentiment darkened. Nike previously issued a similar warning and expectations from major retailers like Target and Walmart have grown subdued as customers pull back.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Shafiqur Rahman)     COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (AP) — The U.S. government has confirmed it would provide $73 million in new financial aid for Rohingya refugees through the United Nations’ food agency, easingworriesamong more than 1 million refugees that essential food rations would be cut. Aid agencies, the U.N. and refugees have voiced concerns after the World Food Program warned it may be affected after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration announced it was cutting international aid. The World Food Program said earlier this month thatif it is not able to raise funds, it will have no option but to halve food rations to $6 a month from previous $12.50 in Bangladesh’s southern coastal district of Cox’s Bazar, where the Rohingya live in sprawling camps. Bangladesh government’s Refugee, Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, told reporters that he received confirmation from the WFP on Thursday that refugees in Cox’s Bazar — as well as the thousands who have been relocated toBhashan Charisland — will continue to receive $12 to $13 a month each in aid. “This food and nutrition support through WFP will provide critically needed food and nutrition assistance for more than one million people,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday. “It is important that our international partners engage with sharing the burden with life-saving assistance such as this,” Bruce added.  The U.S. had been the largest provider of aid to the Rohingya refugees, contributing nearly $2.4 billion since 2017 and providing the U.N. with emergency food and nutrition assistance, according to the State Department. The U.S. provided about $300 million in humanitarian aid for the Rohingyas in 2024. Refugees in Cox’s Bazar welcomed the announcement that aid will continue. “I am glad that the President of America is donating the money, which will help (provide food) our grandchildren. We are very happy,” said 60-year-old Hussain Bahar. Forid Alam, a 36-year-old refugee at Balukhali Rohingya refugee camp, said the announcement was a gift coming days before Muslims’ largest festivalEid al-Fitr. “We are grateful to the people of Bangladesh, its government, and the donors who are donating. We are so thrilled after hearing the news ahead of Eid that we don’t have words to express our gratitude. We are praying from the bottom of our hearts and are truly glad,” he said. U.N. Secretary GeneralAntónio Guterres, whovisited Bangladesh recently, said Cox’s Bazar is “ground zero for the impact of the budget cuts on people in desperate need.” Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya reside in Bangladesh, includingmore than 700,000 who arrivedin 2017 fleeing persecution in Myanmar. About 70,000 others crossed the border from Myanmar in 2024 when, during fighting with the military junta, the opposition force known as the Arakan Army effectively took over the Rakhine state where Rohingya were displaced. Bangladesh says repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar is the ultimate solution, but complexities over verification and other diplomatic and political issues have made the refugees’ return uncertain.
