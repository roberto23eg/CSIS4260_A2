(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)     WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration’s use of a popular messaging app to discuss sensitive military plans — with a journalist onthe text chain— israising questionsabout security and the importance of safeguarding the nation’s secrets. It’s also highlighting the differences between classified and public information, and demonstrating that even encrypted apps like Signal can lead to embarrassing leaks if the humans doing the texting don’t follow basic security tips. President Donald Trump’sadministration says no classified material was leakedwhen senior officials used Signal to discuss upcoming attack plans against the Houthi rebels in Yemen — even though a journalist was on the chat. But even if the information had been declassified by the Pentagon, it contained details that would have been highly valuable to the Houthis or other adversaries, showing how sometimes the decision of what to classify is a judgment call. The federal government routinely classifies vast amounts of information pertaining to military and intelligence operations. The material ranges from top secret nuclear programs or the identities of undercover agents all the way to mundane records that would be of little interest to anyone, let alone America’s adversaries. In 2011, for example, the CIA finally declassified itsrecipe for invisible ink— from 1917. Advocates for open government have long complained that the push for secrecy goes too far, by protecting information that could shine a light on government activities or matters of public interest, including aboutUFO sightingsand a60-year-old presidential assassination.  While the public typically calls any information withheld by the government “classified,” that term only refers to the three broad categories used to “classify” information based on the need for secrecy: confidential, secret and top secret. While files marked “confidential” contain information that’s not meant to be released, the need for security or access restrictions isn’t as great as for material considered “top secret,” which includes the nation’s nuclear secrets and other material that, if released, could pose a grave danger to national security. While the Pentagon hasn’t offered classification details about the information in the Signal chats, information about upcoming military strikes is typically tightly guarded to ensure adversaries don’t have advance warning that could jeopardize the mission or put American service members at risk. The Pentagon closely guards even some publicly available information. Material categorized as “controlled unclassified information,” while not secret, is still considered sensitive enough that military service members are prohibited from discussing it on unsecured devices like personal phones. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were asked about that policy during a Senate hearing this week as they were grilled over the Signal chat. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona noted that Department of Defense policy “prohibits discussion of even what is called controlled unclassified information on unsecured devices,” and asked if Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who oversees the nation’s 18 intelligence agencies, were aware of that rule. “I haven’t read that policy,” Gabbard said. “I’m not familiar with the DOD policy,” Ratcliffe said. The power to classify or declassify lies in the hands of top federal officials, including the president and Cabinet secretaries. For military information like the attack plans discussed over Signal, the power lies with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced demands that he resign over the leak. The president’s ability to declassify information has been invoked when presidents have been accused of mishandling secrets. Trump ally Kash Patel, now the FBI director, hassaid he witnessed Trump declassify materialthat was taken after his first term to the president’s Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, but no evidence has emerged to support that claim. The Pentagon hasn’t said whether Hegseth declassified the attack plans before or after the Signal conversation, but Ratcliffe, Gabbard and the White House have all said the chats contained no classified information. “I haven’t participated in any Signal group messaging that relates to any classified information at all,” Ratcliffe proclaimed at one point. That explanation has failed to satisfy Democrats who say that plans for imminent military strikes are regularly classified. National security experts agree. They say it would be highly unusual for the Pentagon to publicize such information and that any lower-level officer caught leaking such material on Signal would face serious repercussions. For many consumers, encrypted apps likeSignalcan offer greater protections for everyday conversations. But that doesn’t mean they’re secure enough for government secrets, or immune to human error, as the inclusion of a reporter on the text chain shows. Senior federal officials who handle classified data receive extensive training about the need to use approved devices and platforms to discuss government secrets. Intelligence and national security agencies have whole departments devoted to cybersecurity and the protection of state secrets. Government cybersecurity officials haverecommendedthat federal employees use encrypted apps like Signal, which can offer greater security for routine communication, and Ratcliffe said this week it was a “permissible” app for senior officials to use. But the app is only as secure as the device it’s downloaded onto. The government’s most sensitive information is typically discussed in a facility known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, which is designed to allow officials to review or discuss secrets without fear of eavesdropping or cyber intrusion. Any senior official using a personal device to discuss classified material could be at risk of cyberespionage, said Michael Williams, an expert on international relations and national security at Syracuse University. “Signal may be encrypted, but it’s the devices that are really the issue,” Williams said. “All of these people are being targeted.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jennifer Peltz, File)      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he was pullingRep. Elise Stefanik’s nominationto be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a stunning turnaround for hisCabinet pickafter her confirmation had been stalled for months over concerns about Republicans’tight margins in the House.  Trump confirmed he was withdrawing the New York Republican’s nomination in a Truth Social post, saying that it was “essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress.” Flags fly outside the United Nations headquarters Sept. 28, 2019. (AP Photo/Jennifer Peltz, File)   “We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress,” the president said. He did not say whom he would nominate to replace her and fill his last remaining Cabinet seat.  The abrupt withdrawal reflects growing concern among House Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, that their historically slim majority could be at risk, particularly ahead of two special elections in Florida next week. The loss of a mere handful of seats could swing the House majority to Democrats and derail their efforts to enact Trump’s sweeping agenda in the months ahead.  Johnson praised Stefanik, the former No. 4 House leader, as “selfless” and “patriotic” after Trump announced the move.  “It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise’s agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump’s America First policies,” Johnson said in a post on X. He added that he “will invite her to return to the leadership table immediately,” although its unclear what position she would take since there are no vacancies.   Stefanik’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Trump had tapped Stefanik to represent the U.S. at the international body shortly after winning reelection in November. She was seen as amongthe least controversial Cabinet picks, and her nomination advanced out of committee in late January, but House Republicans’ razor-thin majority kept her ultimate confirmation in a state of purgatory for the last several months.  In recent weeks, it had seemed as if Stefanik’s nomination would advance to the Senate floor, given two U.S. House special elections in Florida in districts that Trump easily won in 2024. Filling those vacant GOP seats would have allowed Stefanik to finally resign from the House and given Republicans, who currently hold 218 seats, a little more breathing room on passing legislation in a growingly divided Congress. Democrats hold 213 seats.  Both districts have long been Republican strongholds, and a win by either Democratic candidate would be a major surprise, but House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democratic leaders are looking to at least narrow the margin from November, when Trump carried both districts in the presidential election by more than 30 points.  That, coupled withDemocrats’ upset in a Tuesday special electionfor a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities, has given Republicans pause and pushed some members into full panic mode, according to one congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal concerns.  Trump’s statement Thursday also seemed to indicate an anxiety about the party’s ability to hold on to Stefanik’s seat if she were to take on the U.N. post, even though the sprawling district in northern New York is one of the state’s most conservative and is considered to be solid Republican territory. Stefanik herself cruised to reelection last year, winning 62% of the vote over her Democratic opponent. Almost all of the counties in her district voted for Trump last year.  In a statement, Jeffries, D-N.Y., said that Trump withdrew Stefanik’s nomination “because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her.”  “The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared,” Jeffries continued. “What happened to their so-called mandate?”  Stefanik is the fourth Trump administration nominee who didn’t make it through the confirmation process. Previously, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetzwithdrew from considerationfor attorney general, Chad Chronister was pulled for theDrug Enforcement Administrationand former Florida congressman Dr. David Weldon wasyanked from contentionto lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The former congresswoman had been in a state of limbo for months, not able to engage in her official duties as a member of the 119th Congress or to participate in the action at the U.N. The vacancy of a permanent U.S. ambassador was happening at a critical moment for the international body as the world leaders had been discussing the two major wars betweenRussia and UkraineandIsrael and Hamas.  In late February, the U.S. mission, under Trump, split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in votes on three U.N. resolutions seeking an end to thethree-year war. Dorothy Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., has been the face of America’s mission in New York during the transition.  The withdrawal of Stefanik’s nomination came after she had launched a recent farewell tour of her district, meeting with supporters and thanking them for their support. On her Instagram page, Stefanik had also been conducting what appeared to be a retrospective of her time in Congress, with one post containing images from 2016 that showed her on a cable news show and posing with supporters atop a caption that began with “Congressional throwback continued.”  Reflecting the abruptness of Trump’s decision, Stefanik’s last throwback post was made Thursday morning.

"So long, Park City. Sundance Film Festival to relocate to Boulder, Colorado, in 2027",https://apnews.com/article/sundance-film-festival-boulder-move-562a7b1b8081f0ca7a616b64c357d0ae,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)       After a yearlong search, theSundance Film Festivalannounced Thursday that its new home will be Boulder, Colorado, keeping Sundance in the mountains but moving it out of Park City, the Utah ski town that had for decades provided the premier independent film gathering its picturesque snowy backdrop. Organizers said that after 40 years in the mountains, the festival hadoutgrown Park City,and lacked the necessary theaters or affordable housing to continue hosting what has become one of North America’s most sprawling movie events. Sundance hadnarrowed down the optionsto Salt Lake City (with a smaller presence in Park City), Cincinnati and Boulder. Boulder emerged as their choice due to its close proximity to nature, its small-town charm and an engaged community that, organizer said, provides Sundance the ideal setting for its future. “Boulder is a tech town, it’s a college town, it’s an arts town, and it’s a mountain town,” Amanda Kelso, acting chief executive of the Sundance Institute, said in an interview Thursday from Boulder. “At 100,000 people, a larger town than Park City, it gives us the space to expand.” Kelso, Sundance Institute board chair Ebs Burnough and Eugene Hernandez, director of the festival and head of programming, spoke shortly before announcing the festival’s move. Local officials, who helped lure Sundance with $34 million in tax credits over 10 years, applauded the decision.  “Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator and important contributor to our thriving culture,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (Dem.) said in a statement. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said Thursday that Sundance will come to regret leaving Utah. “As I’ve said from the beginning, we wanted Sundance to stay,” Cox said in a statement. “We made that clear to their leadership and put together a highly competitive package. Ultimately, this decision is theirs to make, but I believe it’s a mistake and that, one day, they’ll realize they left behind not just a place, but their heritage.” A shift from Park City to Boulder means Sundance stays in the mountains but trades a luxury ski resort enclave for a growing, outdoorsy small city. The mile-high Colorado city set in the foothills of the Rockies also maintains a sense of surrounding nature — something organizers stressed as a major factor in their decision. Boulder’s four-block pedestrian mall on Pearl Street, with nearby theaters, could provide a similar sense of central hub like Park City’s Main Street. The Macky Auditorium, on the University of Colorado campus, is expected to be a central stage for Sundance. The Sundance Institute was founded in 1981 by Robert Redford, who sought a location far from Hollywood to foster independent voices in film. In 1984, the institute took over the Sundance Film Festival, but the nonprofit’s mission of helping young filmmakers grow through labs and workshops — Redford’s real passion — continued year-round away from the festival. The 88-year-old Redford, who attended the University of Colorado in Boulder in his youth, gave the move his blessing. “Words cannot express the sincere gratitude I have for Park City, the state of Utah, and all those in the Utah community that have helped to build the organization,” Redford said in a statement. “What we’ve created is remarkably special and defining. As change is inevitable, we must always evolve and grow, which has been at the core of our survival.” The festival made “ethos and equity values” one of its criteria, prompting many to wonder how much local politics would influence the choice by Sundance, which emphasizes inclusivity. Cox is currently weighing a bill that would ban the flying of certain flags at schools and government buildings, including the LGBTQ pride flag. Organizers said Boulder’s “welcoming environment aligns with the ethos” of Sundance. “This process started 18 months ago and we’ve been in Utah for 40 years. So politics really didn’t guide the process,” Burnough said Thursday. “It was really and truly about evolution. That’s where it landed. We didn’t constantly spend time examining what bill was going forward or may or may not be signed.” With its current contract expiration date looming, thehunt for a new host citybegan in earnest in April 2024. The initial group of six contenders also included Atlanta, Louisville, Kentucky, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Before packing up, Sundance will have one last edition in Park City in January 2026. “The Sundance Film Festival will be the Sundance Film Festival wherever we go. What’s consistent is our mission,” said Hernandez. “This is a festival of global discovery. What’s exciting about Boulder is this is a place we can build.” Over the years, Sundance in Park City swelled into a premier marketplace for American film, drawing studio executives and parka-wearing celebrities into the Wasatch mountains every January. It helped launch countless filmmakers over the years, from Steven Soderbergh (“Sex, Lies and Videotape”) to Ryan Coogler (“Fruitvale Station”). Sundance scored its first best picture winner with“CODA”in 2022. Sundance meant big business forUtah and Park City. In 2024, the festival had some 72,840 in-person attendees, 24,200 of whom were coming from out of state. According to the festival’s economic impact report, out-of-state visitors spent an estimated $106.4 million in Utah during the festival. Its total economic impact was estimated to be $132 million, with 1,730 jobs for Utah residents. But the festival had also sparred with local ski resorts — Park City’s other major money maker — as festivalgoers filled the hotels and left the slopes virtually empty for two weeks during peak ski season. The festival was a boon to some local businesses, but a hindrance to others. For visitors flying into the 10-day festival, ballooning rental costs increasingly factored into attending. Debbie Gold, a Florida festivalgoer who “got bit by the Sundance bug” 20 years ago, said she’s not yet sure whether she will continue attending at the new location. “It’s the end of an era, for me anyway, in Park City,” said Gold, whose experiences at Sundance inspired her to get involved with her local Miami Film Festival and some independent film productions. “I don’t think it’ll be quite the same in a new place. But between Boulder and Cincinnati, Boulder at least sounds a little enticing because it’s a cute mountain town.” Sundance’s relocation puts two of the top U.S. film festivals in Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival, held further west in the state, runs in late August. Associated Press Writer Hannah Schoenbaum and Film Writer Lindsey Bahr contributed to this report.

(Pool via AP)         ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Billionaire Elon Musk says a Wisconsin voter has been awarded $1 million days before the conclusion of afiercely contested state Supreme Court electionthat has broken spending records and become areferendum on Musk and the first monthsof President Donald Trump’s administration. The payment to a Green Bay man, which Musk announced Wednesday night on his social media platform X, is similar to a lottery that Musk’s political action committee ran last year in Wisconsin and other battleground states before the presidential election in November. The upcoming election on Tuesday, filling a seat held by a liberal justice who is retiring, will determine whether Wisconsin’s highest court will remain under 4-3 liberal control or flip to a conservative majority. The race has becomea proxy battleover the nation’s politics, with Trump and Muskgetting behindBrad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate in the officially nonpartisan contest. The campaign for the Democratic-supported candidate, Susan Crawford, blasted the $1 million payment from Musk as an attempt to illegally buy influence on the court in a state where Tesla, his electric car company, has alawsuit pendingthat could end up before the court. “It’s corrupt, it’s extreme, and it’s disgraceful to our state and judiciary,” Crawford spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said in a statement.  No legal action against Musk’s payments to voters has been filed in Wisconsin with the Supreme Court election five days away. Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, said the payments were a last-minute attempt to influence the election. “Whether or not Wisconsinites will believe this is legitimate or not probably won’t be settled until after the election,” he said. “But this not what a Wisconsin Supreme Court election ought to be decided on. Races for the high court are supposed to be on judicial temperament and impartiality, not huge amounts of money for partisan purposes.” Musk’s political action committee, America First, announced last week that it wasoffering $100 to voterswho signed a petition in opposition to “activist judges.” He did not say there would be $1 million prizes at that time, but in hispost on Wednesdaysaid an additional $1 million award would be made in two days. It was not clear who determined the winner of the $1 million or how it was done. Musk’s political action committee useda nearly identical tacticbefore the White House election last year,offering to pay$1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. It is a felony in Wisconsin to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote. The Musk petition says it is open only to registered Wisconsin voters, but those who sign it are not required to show any proof that they actually voted. The petition says: “Judges should interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas. By signing below, I’m rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role — interpreting, not legislating.” The petition, while designed to collect data on Wisconsin voters and energize them, also is in line withTrump’s agendaalleging that “activist” judges are illegally working against him. Trump’s administration is embroiled in several lawsuits related to his flurry of executive orders and Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency effort todownsize the federal bureaucracy. During last year’s presidential race, Philadelphia’s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutorsfailed to showthe effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day. America PAC and Building for America’s Future, two groups that Musk funds, have spent more than $17 million trying to help elect Schimel, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice. Musk also has given the Wisconsin Republican Party $3 million this year, which it can then give to Schimel or spend on the race. More than $81 million has been spent on the race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.

Sewage sludge can find a second life on farm fields. Here’s how it’s made,https://apnews.com/article/human-waste-sewage-sludge-farm-fertilizer-how-it-works-05d3656b76223b54b3e14fe0831dd875,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. What goes down your toilet can end up on farm fields across the United States.  Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.  But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. Arecent studyreleased by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.  The amount of these “forever chemicals” that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.  “They are very widespread,” said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they’re not in all biosolids and sometimes it’s only in small amounts, he added.   At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.    After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.     The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.    The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.    After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’sregulations for land-applied biosolids.  “There are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,” including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.    Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.  The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what’s in the water. In addition to human waste, biosolids might contain all kinds of everyday household chemicals like beauty products and pharmaceuticals, some of which may contain forever chemicals, Prasse added. At the Columbus facility, the majority of their waste comes from households and businesses.  The Columbus facility tests the final product for metals and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen every month even when they are being stored before land application.    In Columbus, the city takes half of these dirt-like biosolids to a composting facility nearby, where they are mixed with other organic material like trees and leaves and turned into compost after an additional round of heating and aeration to further kill off pathogens. These biosolids are less regulated and can be used on land such as parks or a residential yard.  The Columbus facility, like most such operations, doesn’t test the incoming material for PFAS, an expensive proposition. Dixon said any future testing or treatment of wastewater for PFAS at his facility would depend on future federal regulations.  ——  Follow Joshua A.

(Matthew Pearson/WABE via AP)         ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia lawmakers are giving up oncreating a statewide databaseto collect information on students who might commit violence, even as they push forward other parts of aschool safety billaimed at preventing a school shooting like the one in September atApalachee High School. House and Senate lawmakers unveiled a compromise version ofHouse Bill 268on Thursday, which then passed the Senate Judiciary committee unanimously. That sets it up for final passage in the closing days of Georgia’s 2025 legislative session. Thepush to share informationwas driven by the belief among many that the Barrow County school system didn’t have a full picture of the warning signs displayed by the 14-year-old accused in the fatal shootings of two students and two teachers. But there was loud opposition from both Democratic and Republican constituencies that the database would create a permanent blacklist with no due process that could treat racial and religious minorities unfairly. “The reason it wasn’t going to fly was pushback from all points of the political spectrum that worried about their child being stigmatized just for an accusation or an uncorroborated complaint,” said Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican representing parts of Barrow County. The compromise version also removed a requirement that all school systems set up formal threat management teams to evaluate whether students may commit violence. That approach is strongly recommended by many national experts, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency already offers training. House Education Committee Chairman Chris Erwin, a Republican from Homer, said he was hopeful schools would voluntarily adopt the model.  “I think there is a knowledge out there of the importance of planning and preparing already in schools,” Erwin said. “So having a full model structure for the state isn’t as important as maybe we once thought it was.” The measure would still require police agencies to report to schools when officers learn that a child has threatened death or injury to someone at a school. But those reports aren’t mandated to become part of a student’s educational record and wouldn’t travel with a student if they transfer to another district. That raises questions about whether the bill addresses one of the key criticisms that followed the Apalachee shooting. School officials never became aware that asheriff’s deputy in Jackson County had interviewed Colt Grayin May 2023 after the FBI passed along a tip that Gray might have posted a shooting threat online. That report would have been forwarded to middle school officials in Jackson County under the bill, but wouldn’t have followed Gray when he enrolled as a freshman in nearby Barrow County after skipping eighth grade entirely. The bill also mandates quicker transfers of records when a student enters a new school, creates at least one new position to help coordinate mental health treatment for students in each of Georgia’s 180 school districts and sets up an anonymous reporting system statewide. Lawmakers on Thursday added in features of separate Senate bills that had passed. They would mandate that all Georgia public schools provide wearable panic buttons to employees. Public schools would also be required to submit electronic maps of their campuses to local, state and federal agencies once a year. The amended bill would also make adult prosecution the default when children aged 13 to 16 are charged with terroristic acts at school, any aggravated assault with a gun, or attempted murder. The Senate had originally proposed a broader range of crimes when adult prosecution would be the default. House leaders had said they didn’t want to submit any more juveniles to adult prosecution.

(AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)                      DENVER (AP) — As Americansstruggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp — yes, the marijuana cousin — to make building blocks for walls.  It’s a response tothe country’s shortfall of millions of homesthat has led to skyrocketing prices,plunging millions into poverty.  “There’s not enough homes to purchase and there’s not enough places to rent. Period,” said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden. A worker inspects the framing of a modular home at the Fading West factory in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)   One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. “I can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing” decades ago.  So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?       In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.  At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.  The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.

(AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)   Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.  The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who’ve been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.  That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.  “You can build faster. The faster you build — even at a high quality — means the lower the price,” Schaefer said. “We see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.”  There’s a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.  Manufactured housingis similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis — like a trailer — and they aren’t subject to the same local building codes. That’s part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.  Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.   Modular homes built by Fading West are seen in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)       Yes, there’s technology to 3D print homes.  A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.  Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.  It’s “a long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,” Hamel said.  The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It’s also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.  The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said  It’s “a technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,” Memari said. “The challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.” Workers construct modular homes at the Fading West factory in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025. ( AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)         Hemp — the plant related to marijuana — is being used more and more in the construction of walls.  The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming “hempcrete,” a natural insulation that’s mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.  Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn’t need the wood studs.  As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.  The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congresslegalized the productionof certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.  Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.  Still, he said, “hempcrete has a bright future.” Modular homes wrapped in plastic await shipping outside of the Fading West factory in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025.

Chinese researchers report a pig kidney transplant and a first-step liver experiment,https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-liver-organ-xenotransplant-china-b0bbc05b80bc7abed7dc7c0cdcf3a0e5,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A miniature pig waits for visitors to feed it at a zoo in Shanghai, China, on Thursday Feb. 15, 2007. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the questfor animal-to-human organ transplants– with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too. A Chinese patient is thethirdperson in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person. Scientists aregenetically altering pigsso their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. —two pig heartsandtwo pig kidneys– were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving – anAlabama womantransplanted in November and aNew Hampshire mantransplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin. Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient “is very well” and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi’an told reporters in a briefing this week. Wang, part of the hospital’s xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago. But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation — learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin — important for basic organ function — although not as much as human livers do.  The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting. “We do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,” Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver. In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of “bridge” supportby externally attaching a pig liverto a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach. In China, Wang’s team didn’t remove the deceased person’s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it. That “clouds the picture,” said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn’t involved with the work. “It’s hopefully a first step but it’s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.” Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome. According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it’s unclear how that experiment turned out.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)                                  DA NANG, Vietnam (AP) — Bui Van Phong faced a choice when the Vietnam War ended 50 years ago: Stay in his small village, helping his parents carry on the family’s centuries-old tradition of making fish sauce, or join the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing his country for a better life.  Phong chose to stay behind and nurtured a business making the beloved condiment, known as nuoc mam in Vietnam, that is now in its fourth generation with his son, Bui Van Phu, 41, at the helm. Fish sauce from the village has been recognized by Vietnam as an indelible part of the country’s heritage and the younger Bui is acutely aware of what that means.  “It isn’t just the quality of fish sauce. It is also the historical value,” he said.  But that heritage is under threat, and not only from giant conglomerates that mass-produce fish sauce in factories. Climate change and overfishing are making it harder to catch the anchovies essential to the condiment that underlies so much of Vietnam and southeast Asia’s food.  Anchovies thrive in large schools in nutrient-rich waters near the shore. But climate change is warming the oceans, depleting oxygen levels in the water. Scientists have long feared that this would lead to smaller fish, as large fish that need more oxygen may migrate or adapt over time by shrinking. Renato Salvatteci, who studies fisheries at the Christian-Albrecht University of Kiel in Germany, said his research into warmer periods millenia ago found support for this in the fossil record.  “If we continue with this trend of deoxygenation, anchovies will not be OK with that,” he said. “Every species has a limit.”   Breaching that limit will have global consequences. Fishers retrieve a net on Nguyen Tat Thanh beach on March, 6, 2025, in Da Nang, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   Warming oceans threaten the ocean ecology and the marine life that inhabits it. It may result in the proliferation of smaller, less nutritious fish and increase costs of fishing and consequently food. Anchovies, for instance, have an outsized role on marine ecology. They’re food for other fish that people eat, like mackerel. They are also vital to make fish meal, used to feed farmed fish.  Overfishing compounds the problem, and geopolitical tensions in the contested waters of the South China Sea — responsible for about 12% of the global fish catch — make management difficult. The destructive industrial fishing practice of dragging large nets along the seabed, scooping up everything in a net’s path, has prevailed since the 1980s. But despite increased fishing, the amount of fish being caught has stagnated, according to a2020 analysis of fishing trends.  Even if the world can limit long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels and halve fishing intensity, the South China Sea will still lose more than a fifth of its fish stocks, warned a 2021assessmentby scientists from the University of British Columbia in Canada. In the most pessimistic scenario — temperatures rising by 7.7 degrees Fahrenheit (4.3 degrees) — nearly all the fish disappear.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   Phu, who teaches information technology by day, also works hard to perfect the fish sauce art handed down by his ancestors.  The anchovies are usually caught between January to March when they congregate off the coast of Da Nang. If they are the right species and size, they get mixed gently with sea salt and put in special tera cotta barrels. Sometimes worms or other ingredients are added to bring in different flavors. Phu ferments this for up to 18 months — stirring the mix several times a week — before it can be strained, bottled and sold to customers.  The sea salt imparts different flavor depending on where it comes from. So does the amount of salt used, and makers have their own recipes; the Bui family uses three parts fish to one part salt. The time allowed for fermentation, and the potential addition of other fish, also affect the flavor of the final product.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)  Worms crawl in the fish sauce made in Nam O fishing village, on March 5, 2025, in Da Nang, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   But it is harder to get the perfect anchovies. The fish catch has decreased — fishermen in markets across Vietnam rue the fact that much of the fish they sell now was considered bait-size in previous decades — and it’s only the good relationships he has with anchovy fishermen that allow him to get the fish directly, avoiding high market prices. The unmistakeable aroma of fermenting fish cloaks the homes of families that still make traditional fish sauce. But Phu said that many families are thinking of getting out of the business because of high anchovy prices.  That may affect Vietnamese plans for a bigger share of the global fish sauce market — projected to increase in value from $18.5 billion in 2023 to nearly $29 billion by 2032, according to a report by Introspective Market Research. Vietnam, along with Thailand, is the world’s largest exporter of fish sauce and is hoping improvements in food safety to satisfy standards in lucrative markets like the U.S., Europe and Japan will help cement a national brand that helps advertise Vietnamese culture to the world.  It’s hard to overemphasize how deeply the condiment is enmeshed in Vietnamese culture. Students living abroad speak of how its taste transports them back home and a top chef says it’s the foundation for flavor in the country’s cuisine. The varying taste of different brews also means everyone — from top businessmen to daily wage workers — has their own opinions about which is the best.  Phu said that each family has their own secrets about making fish sauce. And, nearly fifty years since his father chose to stay back and take care of the family business, he’d like to pass those on to his own son. But he knows that it’ll depend on whether enough anchovies thrive in the sea for the craft to be viable.  “Fish sauce to me is not just a condiment for cooking. But it is our craft, our culture, our tradition that need to be preserved, safeguarded and inherited,” he said.

Live updates: Trump signs order to ‘remove improper ideology’ from Smithsonian museums and zoo,https://apnews.com/live/donald-trump-news-updates-3-27-2025,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. People look during the opening night of the Afro-Atlantic Histories exhibit at the Smithsonian’s National Gallery of Art in Washington, April 7, 2022. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order putting Vice PresidentJD Vancein charge of an effort to“remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo. Trump says there’s been a “concerted and widespread” effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing “objective facts” with a “distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.” The order specifically names the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Other news we’re following today:  Hey, Sally. Thanks for your question. The short answer is: no. At least, that’s according to a judge in Pennsylvania. But we’ll get to that in a second. A group funded by billionaire Elon Musk isoffering Wisconsin voters$100 to sign a petition in opposition to “activist judges,” a move that comes two weeks before the state’sSupreme Court election. On Wednesday, Musk said a Wisconsin voter had been awarded $1 million, which a spokesman for the state’s Democratic-backed candidate called “corrupt.” Musk actuallydid this last year, too, ahead of the general election, which also raised eyebrows at the time. Philadelphia’s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said that prosecutorsfailed to showthat the effort was an illegal lottery and it was allowed to continue through Election Day. So far, the Wisconsin courts haven’t weighed in on the issue. AP reporter Scott Bauer has a story that goes a bit deeper into this.Read his reporting. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing a key part of Trump’s executive order aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients. Judge Matthew Kennelly issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Labor Department from requiring federal contractors or grant recipients from certifying that they don’t operate any DEI programs that violate the country’s anti-discrimination laws. Kennelly’s declined to extend the temporary restraining order to other federal agencies. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by Chicago Women in Trades, a non-profit with several contracts with the Department of Labor. In a telephone rally to support state Rep. Randy Fine for his congressional special election race, Trump credited Fine as being one of 14 Florida legislators who endorsed Trump early on in his recent presidential run. “That’s why Randy will always have a very open door to the Oval Office,” Trump said. “He will be there whenever I need him, and he wants to be there whenever we need him. He wants to be there for you.” Rep. Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay, answers a question about his House Bill 3-C: Independent Special Districts in the House of Representatives April 20, 2022, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla. (AP Photo/Phil Sears, File)  Fine faces Democrat Josh Weil, a public school teacher who has outspent and outraised by nearly 10 times the amount reported by Fine. Trump didn’t note in his remarks any concerns for the race, but he called this an “all-important special election.” Fine said Trump has a “razor-thin majority in the House” and encouraged voters to turn out so he could carry out Trump’s agenda in Congress. The executive order targets another law firm whose lawyers have provided legal work that Trump disagrees with. The order against WilmerHale threatens to suspend active security clearances of attorneys and terminate any federal contracts the firm has. It singled out WilmerHale lawyers Aaron Zebley and James Quarles, who worked on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation looking into the 2016 Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia. Mueller himself has also worked at the firm. Earlier this month, Trump rescinded an executive order targeting the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton after it pledged to review its hiring practices and to provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives. A Turkish student detained by federal law enforcement officers as she walked along a street in a Boston suburb is the latest supporter of Palestinian causes to be swept up in the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants who have expressed their political views. Here’s what to know.  Trump implored his supporters in Wisconsin to vote for conservative state Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel innext week’s election. The president cast the race as a high-stakes battle in an electoral battleground state that will have an “outsized impact on the future of the country.” “It’s a very important race,” Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel’s campaign. “I know you feel it’s local, but it’s not. It’s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.” Trump praised Schimel, a former judge and district attorney, as a tough prosecutor who will work toward the president’s goals, including cracking down on illegal immigration and rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. And he warned that a victory by Schimel’s rival, Judge Susan Crawford, would empower “liberal activists” to enact a “radical left agenda.” Tuesday’s election to replace an outgoing liberal justice could tilt the ideological balance of Wisconsin’s powerful high court is expected to rule in coming years onabortion rights,congressional redistricting,union powerand voting rules.

The order specifically names the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Trump created the “D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force” by executive order. It will be chaired by his homeland security adviser. According to the order, the task force will coordinate with local officials on such things as enforcing federal immigration law, including deporting people living illegally in the city, boost the law enforcement presence, and increase the speed and lower the cost of processing applications to carry concealed weapons. The order also calls for removing graffiti and taking other steps to beautify the city. Trump has talked often about his desire to make the city safer and prettier. Bret Baier asked Musk about one of his most controversial recent social media posts, where he described Sen. Mark Kelly as a “traitor” for his recent trip to Ukraine to show support for the country. Musk didn’t back down from his attack on the Arizona Democrat. “Somebody should care about the interests of the United States above the interests of another country,” Musk said. “And if they don’t, they’re a traitor.” Baier pointed out that Kelly is a veteran, former astronaut and current senator. “That doesn’t mean that it’s OK for him to put the interests of another country before America,” Musk said. The two elections are taking place in conservative congressional districts in Florida, where Democrats have nonetheless far outraised and outspent the Trump-backed Republican candidates. Democrats from across the country have poured millions of dollars into the districts in the hopes of carving into the GOP’s narrow majority in the U.S. House, while Republicans are working to head off the better-than-expected showing by Democrats. Trump won both districts by 30 points or more in November. On Thursday night, Trump joined a telephone rally with supporters of Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who’s running in the state’s 1st Congressional District. “The whole country’s actually watching this one,” Trump said, urging voters in northwest Florida to not sit out this “all-important special election.” Elon Musk speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Md.

But he took an opposite approach when talking about federal workers on Thursday night. “Basically no one has gotten fired,” he said. At least 24,000 probationary employees have lost their jobs already, according to court filings during lawsuits over the layoffs. Tens of thousands more are expected to be cut across the federal government. The billionaire entrepreneur has often talked about his work in existential terms, describing the country as careening toward bankruptcy unless he reduces spending. During the Fox News interview, he made another sweeping claim about the impact of his efforts. “This is a revolution. It might be the biggest revolution in government since the original revolution.” Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier asked Musk how he can reassure people that the cost-cutting he’s doing won’t affect the amount of their Social Security benefits. Without going into specifics, Musk said people “will receive more money, not less money. Let the record show that I said this.” He added, “Check back on this in the future.” Elon Musk holds a chainsaw handed to him by Argentine President Javier Milei, behind, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Oxon Hill, Maryland, Feb. 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  Elon Musk says that he and the Department of Government Efficiency team have made mistakes along the way and want to proceed carefully in their cost-cutting efforts. “I do agree that we actually want to be careful in the cuts, that we want to measure twice, if not thrice, and cut once,” he said. “Which is not to say that we don’t make mistakes.” Musk said it would be like achieving a perfect 1.000 batting average in baseball. “When we do make mistakes, we correct them quickly and we move on,” Musk said. The Fox News interview was a first public glimpse of members of Musk’s team, including Joe Gebbia, a co-founder of Airbnb. He said government systems are antiquated, particularly the retirement process, which relies on an old filing system located in a Pennsylvania mine. “We really believe the government can have an Apple store-like experience,” Gebbia said. Elon Musk and members of his Department of Government Efficiency team sat down with Bret Baier of Fox News. Baier asked him about his status as a special government employee, which includes a time limit of 130 days. Musk said he believes he will have “accomplished most of the work required” to cut the federal deficit by $1 trillion in that timeframe. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said she genuinely doesn’t know how she’ll rule on their request for reinstatement. Regardless, she said the mass firing with little explanation was no way to treat government officials who had done their jobs well and made sacrifices to serve the public. “Thank you for standing up and saying this is not acceptable,” the judge said. The eight were among more than a dozen inspectors general who were dismissed in a Friday-night sweep on the fourth full day of Trump’s second term. An attorney for the eight, former Solicitor General Seth Waxman, said their firings were unlawful because the Trump administration did not give Congress the legally required 30-day notice, nor did it provide “substantive, case-specific rationale” for terminating them. Government attorney Jeremy Newman said the firings were still lawful because the president’s authority to remove them isn’t contingent on giving Congress notice. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday called President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on auto imports “unjustified,” and said Canada would impose “retaliatory trade actions of our own.”  Short answer: We don’t know yet. The executive order is vague on whether it only aims to require new voter registrants to show documentary proof of citizenship or retroactively apply the same requirement to people who are already registered. As written, it seeks to change the federal voter registration form to add the requirement. That could mean anyone who interacts with the form, including if they move or change their name, would have to comply. This question will ultimately be answered and made public if the executive order is implemented –which experts caution is unlikely given the strong legal arguments that itviolates the U.S. Constitution. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said during a hearing Thursday that he’ll issue a temporary restraining order barring Trump administration officials from destroying messages sent over the encrypted messaging app Signal. A nonprofit watchdog, American Oversight, made the request to preserve the texts in which senior national security officials discussed sensitive details of plans for a U.S. military strike against Yemen’s Houthis. The Atlantic published the entire Signal chat on Wednesday. Its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to the discussion that included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top officials. There was no immediate decision in the news agency’s federal lawsuit against the Trump administration. ▶Read more aboutAP’s lawsuit The news media outlet lost the funding earlier this month after Trump issued an executive order to gut the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which funded RFA. The news media outlet argued in the lawsuit that it is unlawful to deny it the congressionally appropriated money. It also said the withholding of the funds jeopardizes the safety of its journalists and undermines its congressionally-mandated mission. President Donald Trump said he was placing 25% tariffs on auto imports, a move the White House claims would foster domestic manufacturing but could also put a financial squeeze on automakers that depend on global supply chains. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says Trump reached out Wednesday night to schedule a call. He said they would speak in “the next day or two.” Carney was sworn in as Canada’s new prime minister on March 14. But he hasn’t spoken with Trump since taking office. It’s unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office. Hakeem Jeffries said as the Trump administration takes a “chainsaw” to the federal government, voters are responding. “Voters are angry all across the country for good reason,” the leader said at his weekly press conference. Democrats are eyeing a pair of special elections for House seats in Florida. And Trump withdrew his nominee to the United Nations, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, avoiding a special election in that state as the House GOP protects its tight margin. Maine Gov. Janet Mills speaks to the press Wednesday after a dedication of the Picker House Lofts in the Continental Mill in Lewiston. (Andree Kehn/Sun Journal via AP)  The U.S. Health and Human Services Department said earlier this month that the Maine Department of Education, Maine Principals’ Association and a high school are each inviolation of Title IXbecause of the participation of transgender athletes. The federal investigation came after a public spat between Trump and Democratic Maine Gov.Janet Millsabout the subject. The department gave the institutions 10 days to comply with a voluntary agreement to settle the issue by banning the athletes. The principals’ association, which oversees high school sports in the state, and the district where the high school in question is located both said they will not comply with the agreement. ▶Read more onthe disagreement Hey, Joshua. Thanks for your question. To answer this one, we asked AP White House reporters Darlene Superville and Aamer Madhani. Here’s what they had to say: Vance thus far has limited his commentary to posts on social media.  He posted on X on Wednesday — after The Atlantic published the contents of the group chat — that “it’s very clear Goldberg oversold what he had.” He did not address his involvement. Jeffrey Goldberg is editor-in-chief of the magazine, which published the chat after the White House insisted that no classified information was shared. Goldberg’s account of being added to the chat by national security adviser Mike Waltz was published on Monday. Vance’s communications director, William Martin, issued a statement on Monday that reinforced Vance’s support for Trump’s foreign policy. In the text chain, the vice president had questioned whether Americans would understand the reasoning behind military strikes against the Houthis. ▶Read moreabout the Signal group chat leak The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee are criticizing the Trump administration’s efforts to cut $3 billion in emergency spending from recent legislation funding the federal government. Congress approved about $12.4 billion in emergency funding as part of the bill. Trump said he did not concur with Congress that some of that was “truly for emergency needs.” Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican committee chair, and Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat, said the president must accept all or none of Congress’ emergency designations. “Just as the President does not have a line-item veto, he does not have the ability to pick and choose which emergency spending to designate,” the two senators wrote in a letter sent Thursday to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Republicans’ concerns about new vulnerabilities extend to Florida, where Democrats have posted a huge fundraising advantage in two special elections set for Tuesday to fill congressional seats vacated by former GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Mike Waltz. Both were named by Trump to fill jobs in his administration, though Gaetz later withdrew from consideration to be Trump’s attorney general. Those districts have long been Republican strongholds, and a win by either Democratic candidate would be a major surprise. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democratic leaders are looking to at least narrow the margin from November, when Trump carried both districts in the presidential election by more than 30 points. The withdrawal of Stefanik’s nomination came after she had launched a recent farewell tour of her district, meeting with backers and thanking them for their support. On her Instagram page, Stefanik had also been conducting what appeared to be a retrospective of her time in Congress, with one post containing images from 2016 that showed her on a cable news show and posing with supporters atop a caption that began with “Congressional throwback continued.” Stefanik was the only member of Trump’s cabinet who had not yet confirmed when he withdrew her nomination. Here’s a look at who is in Trump’s Cabinet, and the Senate votes to confirm them:   As part of a push toundo dozens of environmental regulations, the Trump administration set up an electronic mailbox and asked coal-fired power plants and other industrial polluters to send an email by Monday, seeking a presidential exemption to bypass Biden-era rules requiring them to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites in the interest of national security or if necessary technology isn’t widely available. Environmentalists denounced the email address as a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. The Environmental Protection Agency’s offer was first reported by The New York Times. ▶Read more aboutthe EPA’s exemption for polluters The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Thursday that weak population gains and increased government spending will result in weaker overall economic growth over the next 30 years. The CBO’s latest long-term budget and economic outlook report projects publicly held debt to reach 156% of gross domestic product in 2055. That’s down from last year’s outlook, which said publicly held debt would be equal to a record 166% of American economic activity by 2054. However, that’s not necessarily a positive. The mix of slower population growth and unfettered spending will also result in weaker economic growth as the nation becomes more dependent on working immigrants. “Without immigration, the U.S. population would begin to shrink in 2033,” the CBO report states. ▶Read more on theCBO’s long-term outlook Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., testifies during a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing for her pending confirmation on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)  Trump had tapped Stefanik, a New York Republican, to represent the U.S. at the international body shortly after winning reelection in November. She was seen as among the least controversial Cabinet picks, and her nomination advanced out of committee in late January. It had seemed as if Stefanik’s nomination would advance to the Senate floor in recent weeks, given two U.S. House special elections in Florida in districts that Trump easily won in 2024. Filling those vacant GOP seats would have allowed Stefanik to finally resign from the House and given Republicans, who currently hold 218 seats, a little more breathing room on passing legislation in a growingly divided Congress. Democrats hold 213 seats. Rep.

(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)  The White House has withdrawnRep. Elise Stefanik’s nominationto be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a stunning turnaround for Trump’s Cabinet pick after her confirmation had been stalled over concerns about Republicans’tight margins in the House. Trump confirmed the decision in a Truth Social post on Thursday, saying that it was “essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress.” “We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress,” he said. ▶Read more aboutRep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination Two GOP congressional candidates running in Florida’s special elections say that Trump will be joining telephone town halls later Thursday to help their campaigns as Democrats have outraised them by millions in these heavily Republican districts. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who’s running in the 1st District, and state Sen. Randy Fine, in the 6th District, both posted on X announcing their telephone town halls with Trump. They are looking to replace Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz, both tapped for roles in the Trump administration.Waltz is the national security adviserandGaetz withdrew from considerationto be attorney general amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Trump endorsed both Patronis and Fine. They are heavily favored against Democrats Gay Valimont in the 1st District and Josh Weil in the 6th District. Some national Republicans have expressed concern about Fine’s fundraising and overall campaign. Should the firing of the two FTC commissioners be upheld by the courts, it could pave the way for Trump or future presidents to fire members of the Fed’s governing board, analysts say, threatening its highly prized independence. Trump’s economic officials, however, have said the White House has no intention to fire the chair, Jerome Powell.Last week, Trump criticized the Fed for not cutting its key interest rate. Two members of the Federal Trade Commission fired by Trump have sued the administration, arguing that their removal was illegal. The case has implications for other independent agencies such as the Federal Reserve. Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Democratic members of the five-person FTC, said their March 18 firing would mean that officials at many other independent agencies could also be removed. Their lawsuit says that the firing violates a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision that found the president couldn’t fire members of independent agencies, such as the FTC, without cause. “We make rules that require tech companies to protect children’s privacy online. We promote competition in the pharmaceutical industry to drive prices down,” Slaughter said in a news release. “And we can do all of this because the FTC can’t be bought with campaign contributions or bullied by politicians.” Under theplan announced Thursdayby Health Secretary Kennedy, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration would be absorbed into a new Administration for a Healthy America. Experts told The Associated Press that eliminating SAMHSA could stallprogress on overdose deaths. The agency funds distribution of naloxone, oversees methadone clinics and supports prevention efforts in all 50 states. “There’s a reason why we have reduced overdose in this country: It’s because SAMHSA has been doing its job so well,” said Dr. Ruth Potee, who oversees seven methadone clinics in Massachusetts. “My jaw drops at this news.” Brendan Saloner, an addiction researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said millions of Americans use services supported by SAMHSA, “even if they have never heard the name of the agency.” A Turkish national who is a doctoral student at Tufts University has been detained by federal agents without explanation, her lawyer said on Wednesday. Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville to meet with friends Tuesday night when she was detained by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a petition filed in Boston federal court. Government lawyers said in a court document Thursday that Rumeysa Ozturk of Turkey was moved to a Louisiana detention center before a judge ordered her kept in Massachusetts. A senior Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said her visa is revoked because she “engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.” Hundreds of supporters protested her detention Wednesday night. They say her only known activism was co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper calling on Tufts to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Ozturk’s lawyer said no charges have been filed against her. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani told the government to explain by Friday why she’s detained. ▶Read more aboutthe Tufts University student’s detention Over 150 anti-abortion groups signed onto a letter calling for Planned Parenthood and other centers that provide abortions as well as other health care to be the next target of “cost saving measures by Elon Musk.” “In an era of reexamining federal funding, Congress should start by cutting funding for Big Abortion in the upcoming reconciliation bill,” the letter said. ▶Read more onthe Capitol Hill anti-abortion demonstration Justice Department leaders are proposing eliminating some offices and dramatically restructuring the department, including combining the two agencies responsible for enforcing drug and gun laws, according to a memo reviewed by The Associated Press. The memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche seeks feedback on a reorganization plan that proposes combining the Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives into a “single component agency to achieve efficiencies in resources, case deconfliction, and regulatory efforts.” The plan also calls for combining policy offices and eliminating Main Justice field offices around the country, such as Environment and Natural Resources Division offices in Denver, Seattle, San Francisco and Sacramento.

The group’s executive vice president, Tina Whittington, told The Associated Press that Planned Parenthood is a perfect target for the Department of Government Efficiency’s work targeting waste, fraud and abuse. Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states to decide. The Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center and Justice Action Center say 26,000 children could lose their lawyers and tens of thousands of others will not get legal help if the Trump administration succeeds inending its contractthat supports a national network of providers. The lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in California seeks to immediately restore access to the programs. Otherwise, it says children who crossed the border without a parent or guardian will be forced to navigate thecomplex legal systemalone, denying them due process and leading to systemic chaos and delays. The contract with the Acacia Center for Justice supports legal representation tounaccompanied migrant children under 18and conducts legal orientations — often referred to as “know your rights” clinics — to children in federal shelters. A lawyer for The Associated Press is asking a federal judge to reinstate the agency’s access to the White House press pool and some other events for its reporters and photographers. Charles Tobin says that “AP has now spent 44 days in the penalty box.” The news agency and the Trump administration are in court in a disagreement over the White House’s removal of AP reporters and photographers from the small group of journalists in the pool who follow the president. A lawyer for the government, Brian Hudak, said AP hadn’t shown irreparable harm. “There is no showing of exclusion,” he said, adding that AP can still access events in the East Room and people leaving and coming outside the White House. In actuality, AP has been able to access East Room events only occasionally, at the discretion of the White House. AP photographer Evan Vucci testified that the agency was “basically dead in the water on major news stories.” Vucci took a famous and widely distributed photo of Trump immediately after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last summer. Tobin held up a book published by Trump with the same photo on its cover. Elon Musk attends a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, Monday, March 24, 2025.

The election to fill the seat of a retiring justice has becomea proxy battleover the nation’s politics. The result could keep Wisconsin’s highest court under 4-3 liberal control or flip it to a conservative majority.

The Associated Press and the Trump administration are in court for arguments over the White House’s banning of the news agency from its press pool earlier this year. The AP sued three administration officials including the president’s press secretary after its reporters were barred. The administration says it’s because AP is ignoring an executive order to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. A pedestrian walks past the the E.

It’s not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies.” Macron insisted he would find it quite paradoxical if the U.S. imposes more taxes on their main allies.

ATLANTA (AP) — Auburn coach Bruce Pearl says he wasn’t mixing politics with sports last week when he called for the release of an American hostage in Gaza. “It’s not political. It’s survival,” Pearl told The Associated Press on Thursday following his news conference ahead of No. 1 seed Auburn’s NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 game against No. 6 Michigan on Friday night. After Auburn’s82-70 second-round winover Creighton on Saturday night in Lexington, Kentucky, Pearlopened his postgame news conferenceby calling for the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas. Alexander is a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier who grew up in the United States. Last week, Hamas said it would release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages held there since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire agreement. Pearl, who is Jewish, said he received approval from his players to address the issue last week. “First of all, number one I don’t want to take away from Auburn,” Pearl said Thursday. “I don’t take away from the student-athletes and so I asked their permission if I could start that press conference and mention the name Edan Alexander. And they understood. And it didn’t.” Pearl said it was a rare request. “I really hadn’t done that on the podium since maybe two or three years ago when when Israel and Iran were in an entanglement,” he said.  Even so, Pearl has not been shy about his social media support of President Donald Trump or his criticism of Trump’s 2024 Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. Pearl’s players said Thursday they support his right to comment on political subjects just as he has supported them in such efforts as Black Lives Matter events. “You know, I think Auburn University does a great job of allowing us to really just live as an American, you know, the First Amendment and freedom of speech,” center Dylan Cardwell said Thursday. “Auburn kind of gives us that platform to use our speech to really just show what we’re passionate about. “Bruce Pearl asked players to go out there and talk about things they are passionate about in the same way he has that same right to talk about things that he’s passionate about. Obviously, he is Jewish ... and he’s passionate about Israel. And so I think that he does have the right to obviously be an American and speak about what he’s passionate about, regardless of the fact of what our views are. He comes across as respectful but obviously in a compassionate way.” Pearl led Auburn (30-5) to the Southeastern Conference regular-season championship. The Tigers were ranked No. 1 in the AP Top 25 foreight consecutive weeksfrom Jan. 13 to March 3 before Duke rose to the top spot. Auburn is led by senior forward-center Johni Broome, a unanimousfirst-team All-America pickwho is averaging 18.9 points. 10.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Broome said he respected Pearl reaching out to the team before speaking about the hostage situation last week. “Like he said, he asked us, so he did it in a respectful way, you know, but that’s the type of guy he is,” Broome said. “He has a strong belief and what he loves. But at the end of the day he still asked us to see how we felt about it. And we’re behind our coach doing what he loves.” AP March Madness bracket:https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracketand coverage:https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness.

All Rights Reserved. SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — A judge on Thursday declined to immediately block the U.S. government from taking steps to deporta Cornell University studentwhose visa was revoked over his participation in campus demonstrations. U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Coombe also rejected Momodou Taal’s request to halt the enforcement of two presidential executive orders that spurreda recent crackdownon international students who, like him, have been involved in pro-Palestinian activism. The government says it revoked Taal’s student visa because of his alleged involvement in “disruptive protests,” as well as for disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students. The doctoral student in Africana studies, who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia, was suspended last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He had been continuing his studies remotely. Coombe wrote that Taal, 31, did not meet the high burden for the temporary restraining orders he was seeking. The judge added that Taal had not established that she had jurisdiction to halt his deportation proceedings, which play out in immigration courts. Taal and two co-plaintiffs initiallyfiled a lawsuitagainst the government March 15 seeking to block enforcement of the executive orders that he believed could lead to his deportation, arguing they violate free speech rights.  He was later told that his student visa had already been revoked before the suit was filed, but that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had trouble locating him. He was told to surrender himself to immigration authorities. The Trump administration has recently attempted to remove several noncitizens from the country for participating in campus proteststhat the government deems antisemiticand sympathetic to the militant Palestinian group Hamas. Students say the government is targeting them for advocating for Palestinian rights. A call seeking comment was made to Taal’s lawyer.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Last month, AP sued White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and two other administration officials, demanding reinstatement.  The White House retaliated against the news outlet last month for not following President Trump’s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico. AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports on the AP’s return to court in the fight to reinstate access to White House events.  The notion of banning a news agency for what it says — and for not using the words that a government demands — is extraordinarily unusual in a country whose Constitution guarantees free speech without official interference. By punishing AP for what it publishes, the administration has raised questions about what the White House feels it could punish from news outlets whose words or images it doesn’t like.  The judge questioned whether it’s a court’s place to order the White House which reporters it could or couldn’t exclude from a presidential event. “My instinct is that this has not changed how your client is exercising its free-speech rights,” McFadden told Tobin.   A lawyer for the government, Brian Hudak, said that the AP hadn’t shown irreparable harm to its business. “There is no showing of exclusion,” he said, adding that AP can still access events in the East Room and document who arrives at the White House and leaves it. The AP says that it has had only sporadic access to East Room events.  Hudak brought no White House officials in as witnesses on Thursday. The AP brought its chief White House photographer and reporter as witnesses to explain how their job has been affected. Tobin said that the AP has already lost a $150,000 advertising contract by a client concerned about the ban.          Evan Vucci, the AP photographer, testified that the agency was “basically dead in the water on major news stories.” Vucci took a renowned and widely distributed photo of Trump immediately after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last summer; in court, Tobin held up a book published by Trump’s allies that depicted the same photo on its cover.  In his testimony, Vucci said the AP relied on his eyes and expertise to often get photos from the Oval Office on the wire and to the world within a minute after taking them — while the event is still going on.  The AP’s chief White House correspondent, Zeke Miller, also detailed how AP was able to get news to the world quickly while events were happening. But the ban has cut into that ability. Miller said AP wasn’t able to get news out about a delay in instituting tariffs against Canada and Mexico until nearly 40 minutes after a competitor.  “We don’t see the president nearly as much as we did before this ban took effect,” Miller said.  Miller also said that he had noticed that the tone and tenor of questions asked of the president had softened since the AP ban, suggesting that it had a chilling effect on other journalists. But he could not offer specific examples when pressed by the judge.  In cross-examination of the two journalists, Hudak tried to establish that the ban was not as harmful as the AP was making it out to be. For example, he noted that the outlet was able, through licensing deals with other companies, to sell photos from events where it was excluded.      In last month’s hearing,McFadden refused the AP’s request for an injunction to stop the White House from barring reporters and photographers from events in the Oval Office and Air Force One. He urged the Trump administration to reconsider its ban before Thursday’s hearing. It hasn’t.  The AP has sued Trump’s team for punishing a news organization for using speech that it doesn’t like. The news outlet said it would still refer to the Gulf of Mexico in its style guidance to clients around the world, while also noting that Trump has ordered it renamed the Gulf of America.  “For anyone who thinks the Associated Press’s lawsuit against President Trump’s White House is about the name of a body of water, think bigger,” Julie Pace, the AP’s executive editor, wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. “It’s really about whether the government can control what you say.”  The White House said it has theright to decide who gets to question the president,and has taken steps to take over a duty that has been handled by journalists for decades.  The president has dismissed the AP as a group of “radical left lunatics” and said that “we’re going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America.”      The case is one ofseveral aggressive movesthe second Trump administration has taken against the press since his return to office, including FCC investigations against ABC, CBS and NBC News,dismantling the government-run Voice of Americaandthreatening funding for public broadcasters PBS and NPR.  The AP has still covered the president, and has been permitted in Leavitt’s press briefings, but the ban has cost the organization time in reporting and impeded its efforts to get still images. Even if McFadden rules in favor of the news organization, it’s unclear how the White House will respond to the judge’s order.   David Bauder covers media for The Associated Press.

(Smith later resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and received a 10-year ban from the Oscars.) In 1794, Congress approved the “Act to provide a Naval Armament” of six armed ships, which provided the foundation of the permanent U.S. Navy. In 1912, in Washington D.C., first lady Helen Herron Taft and the wife of Japan’s ambassador to the United States, Viscountess Chinda, planted the first two of 3,000 cherry trees given to the U.S. as a gift by the mayor of Tokyo. In 1939, the first NCAA men’s Division I basketball championship game was held, with the University of Oregon defeating Ohio State, 46-33. In 1964, Alaska was hit by a magnitude 9.2 earthquake (still the strongest on record in North America) and tsunamis that together claimed over 130 lives. In 1968, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man to orbit the Earth in 1961, died when his MiG-15 jet crashed during a routine training flight near Moscow; he was 34. In 1973, “The Godfather” won the Academy Award for best picture of 1972, but its star, Marlon Brando, refused to accept his Oscar for best actor and, in what would become one of the Oscars’ most famous moments, sent in his place actor and activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who spoke out about the depiction of Native Americans in Hollywood. In 1975, construction began on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline; the 800-mile pipeline was completed just over two years later. In 1977, in aviation’s deadliest disaster, 583 people were killed when a KLM Boeing 747, attempting to take off in heavy fog, crashed into a Pan Am 747 on an airport runway on the Canary Island of Tenerife.

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — He’s back. If there’s a single player Duke or any of its fans would love to not run into when the stakes are this high, Caleb Love would be that player. Love used to play for Duke’s biggest rival, North Carolina. Now he plays for Duke’s next opponent, Arizona. They meet Thursday in the Sweet 16, with Love, now a fifth-year senior averaging 16.8 points a game for the fourth-seeded Wildcats, trying to wreck another season for the top-seeded Blue Devils, who have seen this movie before. Love was the one who burned Duke for 22 points in 2022 to hand coach Mike Krzyzewski aloss in his last game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. He’s the one who, four weeks later, hit the 3-pointer with 25 seconds left, then a couple of more free throws to put away Duke at the Final Four — andofficially end Coach K’s career. “I just think that’s me not being afraid of the moment and me trying to impose my will,” Love explained. “Kind of like my St. Louis swagger to the game.” In nine career games against Duke, he is a modest 5-4. His scoring average in the wins: 20.8. In the losses: 9.8. If Duke (33-3) wins Thursday, almost certainly it will be because the Blue Devils were successful in shutting down Arizona’s best player. “The thing he does is, he can shoot shots at any time and he can hit shots at any time,” said Jon Scheyer, who took over for Krzyzewski at Duke. “He’s an improved passer, someone who’s not afraid. A really good player, and a challenge for our guys.”  Love grew up in St. Louis, committed to North Carolina and played his first three seasons there. The year after the big wins over Duke, the Tar Heels opened the season at No. 1 in the AP poll but became the first preseason No. 1 to miss March Madness. The player who alsoscored 27 in the second halfof the Sweet 16 win on the way to that 2022 Final Four was suddenly seen as someone who shot too much, couldn’t come up big anymore and was bogging down the Tar Heels. Into the transfer portal he went. A move to Michigan got submarined by problems with the admissions department. Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd was on a postseason family trip in Puerto Vallarta when Love called, saying he wanted to visit campus. “My wife flew down and right when she landed, I said ‘I’m going back to Tucson for another day,’” Lloyd said. “Went back, had a great visit,and he committed. Listen, it’s been an awesome experience.” Since the bracket came out, thepossibility of this reunionhas been lingering. When Love wasasked about it on TVafter Arizona’s win over Oregon last Sunday, he looked ready to launch, but he paused, gave a subtle grin and took the diplomatic route: “We’ll be ready for them when it’s time.” Asked about that exchange Wednesday, he explained: “I didn’t want to give them no fuel or bulletin board material. I just wanted to focus on what this group got to do and not give them anything that they can feed off of.” Not the worst approach. Starting with freshman Cooper Flagg, whoseankle injury looks like a worry from the past, the Blue Devils have up to six players who might get picked in the NBA draft. Loaded with talent, they were not challenged during the first week of the tournament, beating Mount Saint Mary’s by 44 and Baylor by 23. Of their 33 wins this season, 28 — including one in November over these Wildcats — have come by double digits. Of those, 11 have been by 30-plus. So, it’s no surprise that the Wildcats come in as a 9 1/2-point underdog — the biggest on the board in a Sweet 16 filled with nothing but power programs. That has nothing to do with Love’s thinking as he heads into matchup No. 10 against the Blue Devils. “We’re not shying away from anything,” he said. Knowing how he’s bedeviled them, why would they? In Thursday’s opening East Regional game, Alabama faces BYU in matchup of two of the nation’s best offenses. So, naturally, both teams are talking about defense. The second-seeded Crimson Tide face the sixth-seeded Cougars in a game expected to be an up-and-down affair filled with 3-point shots and transition buckets. Alabama coach Nate Oats said his scouting report pegs BYU, which ismoving to a wide-open, NBA style of play, as having the best offense in college basketball since Feb. 12. The Crimson Tide needs no such qualifiers — they lead the nation in scoring at 90.8 points a game. “It should be a very fun game, but it’s going to come down to getting stops,” said Mark Sears, who leads the Tide in points (18.6) and assists (5.0). Both these teams can score from anywhere. They prefer 3-pointers — both are in the country’s top 25 in attempts — or high-percentage layups. They are both ranked in the top 10 in KenPom’s offensive efficiency ratings. “I’m excited to hopefully be able to play some good defense, not have it be 150-149, or something like that,” BYU’s Trevin Knell said.

Australia to hold general elections on May 3 with inflation and a housing shortage major issues,https://apnews.com/article/australia-elections-may-albanese-dutton-02913607505793ad3436342c237317e3,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rod McGuirk, File)      MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australians will go to the polls on May 3 for general elections with high costs of living and a shortage of housing likely weighing against the government as Prime MinisterAnthony Albanese‘s center-left Labor Party seeks a second three-year term. Albanese drove to Governor-General Sam Mostyn’s official residence on Friday to trigger the election and announced the date later at a news conference at Parliament House. “Over the last few years, the world has thrown a lot at Australia. In uncertain times, we cannot decide the challenges that we will face, but we can determine how we respond,” Albanese said. “Our government has chosen to face global challenges the Australian way: helping people under cost-of-living pressure while building for the future,” he added. Many expect opposition leader Peter Dutton’s conservative coalition to pick up seats in the House of Representatives. An Australian government has not been ousted after a single term since 1931, when the nation was grappling with the Great Depression. But Australian governments almost always lose ground in their second election and Labor only holds 77 of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives, where governments need a majority. Redistributions mean there will be only 150 seats after the next election. One likely outcome is a minority government supported by independent or minor party legislators.  The2022 electionbrought a record 19 lawmakers who were not aligned to either the government or opposition into the Parliament. Unaligned lawmakers could be crucial to whether Labor or Dutton’s conservative Liberal Party forms Australia’s first minority election since the 2010 election. Adam Bandt, leader of the minor Greens party, said his lawmakers would support a Labor minority government if Labor met Greens’ demands. Those demands included a ban on new coal and gas extraction projects, provding free dental care for all and capping rent increases, he said. “With a minority government on the cards this election, this is a once-in-a-generation chance to keep Peter Dutton out and get Labor to act on the housing crisis, the cost-of-living crisis and the climate and environment crisis,” Bandt told reporters. The Greens supported a Labor minority government elected in 2010 and initated a short-lived Australian carbon tax which was repealed by a conservative government after the next election. Cost of living pressures have increased across Australia since Albanese came to power, with 12 interest rate hikes since the last election. However,Australia’s central bankreduced the benchmark cash rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.1%, in February in a sign that the worst of the inflationary pressures has passed. Albanese promised to reduce a housing shortage by building 1.2 million homes over five years, but the 2023 pledge has got off to a slow start. Dutton has promised to reduce competition for housing by reducing immigration. He would also allow Australians to spend savings in their compulsory workplace pension funds on down payments to buy new homes. Both parties have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. But the government would rely on renewable energy sources including solar panels and wind turbines to replace coal and gas, while the opposition would build seven state-fundednuclear power plants. The opposition also advocates adding new gas-fired power generation to maintain electricity supply until nuclear power arrives.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)           A congressional hearing Thursday reinforced the idea that the Januarymidair collisionbetween an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter thatkilled all 67 peopleaboard both aircraft could have been prevented. The Federal Aviation Administration already had data showing an alarming number of close calls around Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C., but didn’t spot the trend. The agency’s acting administratorpromised improvementand said the agency will complete a review of data from other airports with heavy helicopter traffic within the next couple weeks. Investigators are still in the early stages of determining why the jetliner and helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land Jan. 29. The final report likely won’t be ready until sometime next year. Here’s a look atthe collision: American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members as it approached to land on a clear night. Nearby, the Army Black Hawk, with three soldiers on board, was practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in an emergency. Investigators have said the helicopter crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision. A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane turned to adjust its approach. The FAA has sincepermanently bannedthat particular helicopter route when planes are using that runway.  Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert saying the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for “visual separation” with the jet for a second time, allowing it to fly closer than if the pilots couldn’t see the plane. Controllers approved the request roughly 20 seconds before the collision. The National Transportaty Safety Board has said there were85 dangerous close callsbetween planes and helicopters near Reagan National in the three years before the crash, and collision alarms had been ordering pilots to take evasive action at least once a month since 2011. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters last month that the Black Hawk’s cockpit recorder suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew unable to hear air traffic control tell them, just before the crash, to move behind the jet. She said the crew was unable to hear the words “pass behind the” because its microphone key was pressed. The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters) at the time, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location. Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicate that the crew may not have had accurate altitude readings, with the helicopter’s pilot calling out that they were at 300 feet (91 meters) but the instructor pilot saying 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said. That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters: one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter’s black box captures its radio altitude. Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump faulted the helicopter forflying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. Whenpressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, he blamed an“obsolete” air traffic control system. The Army identified the Black Hawk crew asCapt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O’Hara was the crew chief, and Eaves and Lobach were pilots. Among the jet’s passengers were severalmembers of the Skating Club of Bostonwho were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championshipsin Wichita. Afigure skating tribute eventin Washingtonraised $1.2 millionfor the crash victims’ families. Others included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas; four members of a steamfitters’ union in suburban Maryland; nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia; and two Chinese nationals. A string of recent crashes and a near miss have brought attention to air travel, which remains overwhelmingly safe. On Jan. 31 a medical transport jetcrashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven. On Feb. 6a small commuter aircraft went downoff western Alaska, killing 10. On Feb. 17, a Delta planecrashed and flipped overupon landing in Toronto but everyone survived. Two small planescollided in midair in Arizonaon Feb. 19, killing two people. And there was a scary moment Feb. 25 in Chicago when a Southwest Airlines plane came within 200 feet of crashing into another plane crossing the runway before itaborted its landing to avoid it. The Washington collision was thedeadliest plane crash in the U.S.since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)                TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday that he would speak with U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming days after Trump announced25% tariffs on auto imports. Carney, who hasn’t spoken with Trump since becoming Canada’s new leader nearly two weeks ago, said that the U.S. president reached out Wednesday night to schedule a call. “We will be speaking soon, certainly in the course of the next day or two,” Carney said, adding that Trump has to respect Canada’s sovereignty. “That’s not much to ask, but apparently it’s a lot for him,” he said. Trump has declared a trade war on Canada and continues to call for the United States’ northern neighbor to become the 51st U.S. state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. “It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner. It is possible that, with comprehensive negotiations, we will be able to restore some trust, but there will be no turning back,” Carney said. “We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States. We will need to pivot our trade relationships elsewhere.” The former central banker was sworn in as Canada’s new prime minister on March 14. It’s unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office. Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as Canada’s leader and the head of the Liberal Party, is at the start of a five-week campaign after calling an early election for April 28.  The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war and challenged Canada’s sovereignty. The crisis has created a surge in patriotism among Canadians, with many in the country feeling that Carney is the best person to lead the country at the moment. Trump has acknowledged himself that he has upended Canadian politics. Carneycalled the tariffs unjustifiedand left the election campaign to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations in Ottawa. “We will fight the U.S. tariffs with retaliatory trade actions of our own that will have maximum impact in the United States and minimum impacts here in Canada,” Carney said. He said many Canadians are feeling worried and anxious about the future. He said over the coming years Canadians must fundamentally reimagine the economy in a drastically different world. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. “The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over,” he said. Carney is asking Canadians for a clear and strong mandate given “the biggest crisis in our lifetimes.” Automobiles are Canada’s second-largest export and the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries. Carney announced this week a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs. Trump previously had granted aone-month exemptionon his stiff new tariffs on auto imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan. Trump previously placed 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as on all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. The presidenthas plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales. “This is not an industry that is Donald Trump’s to steal or take,” said Lana Payne, the National President of Unifor, the union that represents auto workers in Canada. Payne said that Carney should tell Trump that if U.S. automakers are going to sell cars and trucks in Canada, they are going to have to build in Canada. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said Trump needs to “knock it off” when asked by journalists about the president’s repeated attacks. “We will never be the 51st state but we can be friends again with the United States if he reverses course,” Poilievre said.

(AP Photo/Luis Nova) SAO PAULO (AP) — Former Brazilian PresidentJair Bolsonaroscored a legal win on Thursday after the country’s prosecutor-general tossed a federal police investigation that accused him of falsifying his COVID-19 vaccination status. The decision of Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet came one day after a panel of Supreme Court justicesruled that Bolsonaro and seven of his allies will stand trialon five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election. Gonet argued in his decision sent to the Supreme Court, which will have the final word on the case, that he did not find enough evidence against Bolsonaro in the federal police accusation he received one year ago. Federal police accused Bolsonaro and his aides oftampering with the health ministry’s databaseshortly before he traveled to the United States in December 2022, two months after he lost his reelection bid toLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvaand shortly before the leftist leader took office for the third time in his career. Bolsonaro needed a certificate of vaccination to enter the U.S., where he remained for the final days of his term and the first months of Lula’s term. The former president has repeatedly said he has never taken a COVID-19 vaccine. Brazil’s federal police alleged that Bolsonaro and 16 others had inserted false information into a public health database to make it appear as though the then-president, his 12-year-old daughter and several others in his circle had received the COVID-19 vaccine.  The investigation said the false vaccination data had been inserted in the public system by a city hall staffer of the city of Duque de Caxias, outside Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro has always denied any wrongdoing in the case. Federal police said in its accusation that Bolsonaro’s aide-de-camp, Mauro Cid, told investigators in a plea bargain testimony that the former president had asked him to insert the false data into the system for both himself and his daughter. Cid also said he delivered the vaccination certificates to Bolsonaro personally. Gonet argued that other sources and documents did not validate that accusation. During the pandemic, Bolsonaro was among the few world leaderswho railed against the vaccine, openly flouting health restrictions and urging other Brazilians to follow suit.

Patel made no such commitments during the course of two days of Senate and House hearings, declining to comment on the possibility and testifying that he had not personally reviewed the text messages that were inadvertently shared with the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic who was mistakenly included on an unclassified Signal chat.  That Patel would be grilled on what the FBI might do was hardly surprising.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)   Even as President Donald Trump insisted “it’s not really an FBI thing,” the reality is that the FBI and Justice Department for decades have been responsible for enforcing Espionage Act statutes governing the mishandling — whether intentional or negligent — of national defense information like the kind shared on Signal,a publicly available appthat provides encrypted communications but is not approved for classified information.  The Justice Department has broad discretion to open an investigation, though Attorney General Pam Bondi, who introduced Trump ata Justice Department eventthis month, signaled at an unrelated news conference on Thursday that she was disinclined to do so. She repeated Trump administration talking points that the highly sensitive information in the chat was not classified, though current and former U.S. officials have said the posting of the exact launch times of aircraft and times that bombs would be released before those pilots were even in the air would have been classified.   Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks at a news conference at the Justice Department, Feb. 12, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File)   She also quickly pivoted to two Democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Joe Biden, who found themselves under investigation but never charged for allegedly mishandling classified information. Indeed, the department has conducted multiple high-profile investigations in recent years, albeit with differences in underlying facts and outcomes.   Multiple high-profile figures have found themselves under investigation in recent years over their handling of government secrets, but the differences in the underlying facts and the outcomes make it impossible to prognosticate what might happen in this instance or whether any accountability can be expected. There’s also precedent for public officials either to avoid criminal charges or be spared meaningful punishment.  “In terms of prior investigations, there were set-out standards that the department always looked at and tried to follow when making determinations about which types of disclosures they were going to pursue,” including the sensitivity of the information exposed the willfulness of the conduct, said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Zweiback, who has handled classified information investigations. AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on the continuing standoff between the White House and Democrats over a chat on the Signal app.  A look at just a few of the notable prior investigations:    The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee wasinvestigated but not chargedfor her use of a private email server for the sake of convenience during her time as secretary of state in the Obama administration. There appear to be some parallels with the Signal chat episode.  The politically fraught criminal investigation was initiated by a 2015 referral from theintelligence agencies’ internal watchdog, which alerted the FBI to the presence of potentially hundreds of emails containing classified information on that server. Law enforcement then set out to determine whether Clinton, or her aides, had transmitted classified information on a server not meant to host such material.  The overall conclusions were something of a mixed bag.  Then-FBI Director James Comey, in a highly unusual public statement, asserted that the bureau had found evidence that Clinton was “extremely careless” in her handling of classified information but recommended against charges because he said officials could not prove that she intended to break the law or knew that the information she and her aides were communicating about was classified.  The decision was derided by Republicans who thought the Obama administration Justice Department had let a fellow Democrat off the hook. Among those critical were some of the very same participants in the Signal chat as well as Bondi, who as Florida’s attorney general spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and mimicked the audience chant of “Lock her up!”      Among the biggest names to actually get charged is Petraeus,the former CIA directorsentenced in 2015 to two years’ probation for disclosing classified information to a biographer with whom he was having an extramarital affair.  That material consisted of eight binders of classified information that Petraeus improperly kept in his house from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Among the secret details in the “black books” were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus’ discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors have said.  Petraeus, a retired four-star Army general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wound up pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor count of unauthorized retention and removal of classified material as part of a deal with Justice Department prosecutors. Some national security experts said it smacked of a double-standard for its lenient outcome.  Comey himself would later complain about the resolution, writing in a 2018 book that he argued to the Justice Department that Petraeus should have also been charged with a felony for lying to the FBI.  “A poor person, an unknown person — say a young black Baptist minister from Richmond — would be charged with a felony and sent to jail,” he said.    These investigations don’t bear much parallel to the Signal episode but nonetheless serve as examples of high-profile probes launched by the department into the mishandling of classified information.  Both found themselves investigated by Justice Department special counsels,with Trump being charged with hoarding top-secret recordsat his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump had taken those records after leaving office. He was also accused of showing off a Pentagon attack plan to a visitor at his Bedminster golf club.  The case was dismissed by a Florida-based judge who concluded that special counsel Jack Smith had been improperly appointed. Prosecutors abandoned the case after Trump won in November.  Biden, too, was investigated for his retention of classified information in his home following his tenure as vice president. A special counsel found some evidence that Biden had willfully retained the records but concluded that criminal charges were not merited.    A former CIA officer, Sterling was convicted of leaking to a reporter details of a secret mission to thwart Iran’s nuclear ambitions by slipping flawed nuclear blueprints to the Iranians through a Russian intermediary.  He wassentenced in 2015 to 3 1/2 years in prison, a punishment whistleblower advocates and other supporters decried as impossible to square with Petraeus’ misdemeanor guilty plea just a month earlier.  The details of the operation disclosed by Sterling were published by journalist James Risen in his 2006 book “State of War.”  Sterling was charged in 2010, but the trial was delayed for years, in part because of legal wrangling about whether Risen could be forced to testify. Ultimately, prosecutors chose not to call Risen as a witness, despite winning legal battles allowing them to do so.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
Nearly 200 dogs seized from ex-NFL star in dogfighting case,https://apnews.com/article/dog-fighting-charges-leshon-johnson-54429a2172f20720d29b30b7da0bbcf6,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BROKEN ARROW, Okla. (AP) — Former NFL player Leshon Johnson has been indicted for allegedly operating a large dogfighting venture that resulted in authorities seizing 190 dogs — considered the most ever taken from one person in a federal dogfighting investigation, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Johnson, of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, has been charged with possessing the pit bull-type dogs for use in an animal fighting venture and for selling, transporting, and delivering a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, the department said Tuesday. The dogs were taken from Johnson in October 2024. He allegedly ran the dogfighting operation “Mal Kant Kennels” in Broken Arrow and Haskell, Oklahoma, according to court documents. “Animal abuse is cruel, depraved, and deserves severe punishment,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “The Department of Justice will prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law and will remain committed to protecting innocent animals from those who would do them harm.” Johnson previously pleaded guilty to state animal fighting charges in 2004 in Oklahoma. He was given a five-year deferred sentence, according to court documents. Johnson’s lawyer, Courtney R. Jordan, did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. Johnson allegedly bred dogs that had won as many as five fights and then sold “stud rights” and their offspring to other dogfighters. The trafficking took place across the U.S. and helped to grow the dogfighting industry, while resulting in Johnson profiting financially, according to the Justice Department.  If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison on each count and a $250,000 fine. “The FBI will not tolerate criminals that harm innocent animals for their twisted form of entertainment,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement. “The FBI views animal cruelty investigations as a precursor to larger, organized crime efforts, similar to trafficking and homicides. This is yet another push in the FBI’s crackdown of violent offenders harming our most innocent.” Johnson was a running back who played for the Green Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants from 1994-1999.

(Kirill Zykov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)                              MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that President Donald Trump’s push for control overGreenlandwasn’t surprising given longtime U.S. interest in the mineral-rich territory. Speaking at a policy forum in the Artic port of Murmansk, Putin noted that the United States first considered plans to win control over Greenland in the 19th century, and then offered to buy it from Denmark after World War II. “It can look surprising only at first glance and it would be wrong to believe that this is some sort of extravagant talk by the current U.S. administration,” Putin said. “It’s obvious that the United States will continue to systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic.” Trump irkedmuch of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Fridayon a trip that was scaled backafter an uproar by Greenlanders and Danes. Speaking on Thursday, Putin noted that Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening itsmilitary capabilityin the polar region.  “We are certainly concerned about NATO members describing the Far North as the region of possible conflicts,” he said, noting that Russia’s neighbors Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance. “Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernizing military infrastructure.” Russia has sought to assert its influence over wide areas of the Arctic in competition with the United States, Canada, Denmark and Norway as shrinking polar ice from the warming planet offers new opportunities for resources and shipping routes. China also has shown an increasing interest in the region, believed to hold up to one-fourth of the Earth’s undiscovered oil and gas. “We won’t allow any infringement on our country’s sovereignty, reliably safeguard our national interests while supporting peace and stability in the polar region,” Putin said. While pledging to strengthen Russia’s military foothold in the Arctic, Putin said that Moscow was holding the door open to broader international cooperation in the region. “The stronger our positions will be, the more significant the results will be and the broader opportunities we will have to launch international projects in the Arctic involving the countries that are friendly to us, and, possibly, Western countries if they show interest in joint work. I’m sure the time will come to launch such projects.” Kirill Dmitriev,head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Putin’s envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S. officials, told reporters last month that Russia and the U.S. should develop joint energy ventures. “We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions,” he said.

Former executive of Mars candy subsidiary charged with stealing $28 million from company,https://apnews.com/article/mars-candy-theft-executive-charged-60279494f51cdfde315edb684cddf205,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Before his arrest Wednesday, Paul Steed was a respected sugar market expert for a subsidiary of famed candymaker Mars Inc. He served on a U.S. trade advisory committee for sweeteners as well as on industry group boards, while giving presentations at conferences. Now Steed, of Stamford, Connecticut, is accused in a federal indictment of stealing more than $28 million from Mars since about 2013 through various schemes, including diverting funds to companies he set up. He is charged with seven counts of wire fraud and two counts of tax evasion. Steed, 58, a dual U.S. and Argentine citizen, pleaded not guilty in federal court in Bridgeport on Wednesday and was ordered detained pending trial. A U.S. magistrate judge said Steed was a flight risk and noted that while the government has seized $18 million of the allegedly pilfered funds, several million dollars remain unaccounted for and Steed has strong connections to family in Argentina. Steed’s lawyer, federal public defender Phoebe Bodurtha, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday. His wife, Martina Steed, told The Associated Press in a brief phone call that she did not know all the facts of the case and declined further comment. Mars Inc. said in a statement that the case involves “the action of a single individual who sought to exploit the organization for personal gain.”  “We fully cooperated with law enforcement to see this matter quickly brought to justice and always remain committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and integrity in all our operations,” it added. Steed worked remotely from his Stamford home as global price risk manager for Mars Wrigley, according to federal prosecutors. The company is a subsidiary of McLean, Virginia-based Mars Inc., the maker of M&M’s, Snickers, Skittles, Altoids mints and Doublemint gum, as well as other food products and pet food. Steed and his wife appeared to be living beyond their means, according to the judge’s order authorizing his pretrial detention. Steed’s annual salary was about $200,000 while his wife was making $40,000 to $50,000 a year as a hair stylist, Magistrate Judge S. Dave Vatti said in the order. Yet they paid $2.5 million in cash in 2023 for a property in wealthy Greenwich, Connecticut, and own a mortgage-free home in Stamford worth $1 million, he wrote. Steed also sent $2 million over the past several years to relatives, other people and entities in Argentina, where he apparently owns a cattle and tea ranch, according to the order. In July 2012 he set up a company, Ibera LLC, and a year later he began submitting false invoices from it to Mars, according to the federal indictment. The scheme allegedly went on until December 2020, with Steed stealing nearly $580,000 with the bogus invoices. A bigger scheme beginning in 2016 would result in the diversion of millions of dollars from Mars through another Steed-created company, MCNA LLC, the indictment said. Prosecutors say Steed told certain sugar refineries who were buying “re-export credits” from Mars to send the money to MCNA instead. Steed also used MCNA in other scams including one involving the theft of more than $11 million from the sale of Mars’s shares in a financial services company, according to the indictment. Steed was appointed in early 2021 by then-U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to serve on an agricultural trade advisory committee for sweeteners and sweetener products. In a LinkedIn posting previewing a commodities conference in New York City last year, Steed was listed as serving in several sugar industry groups, including being a former president of the New York Sugar Club. He also was a member of the Intercontinental Exchange’s Sugar Contract Committee and a board member of the U.S. Sugar Users Association.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
"US economic growth to slow in the next 30 years, fueled by debt and declining birth rates, CBO says",https://apnews.com/article/cbo-budget-trump-tax-cuts-2cd7d163780a2a32517ac99efa982ead,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks with reporters at the White House, March 13, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Scott Bessent, United States Secretary of the Treasury, speaks at an Economic Club of New York luncheon in New York, March 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)     WASHINGTON (AP) — Weak population gains and increased government spending will result in slower overall economic growth over the next 30 years, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Thursday. The CBO’s latest long-term budget and economic outlook report — for a timeframe that spans 2025 to 2055 — projects publicly held debt to reach 156% of gross domestic product, or GDP, in 2055. That’s down from the agency’sMarch 2024 long-term budget projection, which said publicly held debt would be equal to a record 166% of American economic activity by 2054. However, that’s not necessarily a positive. The mix of slower population growth and unfettered spending will also result in weaker economic growth over the next three decades than what the CBO projected last year. Lower birthrates also mean that the United States is becoming moredependent on immigrants workingto sustain growth. “Without immigration, the U.S. population would begin to shrink in 2033,” the CBO report states. The report assumes that all the laws set to expire, including certain provisions of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, will expire. But the White House and Republican lawmakers have said that the tax cuts will be renewed and potentially expanded, as well as suggesting reductions in government spending and an increase in revenues by taxing imports. Still, the report’s warnings and its projections for the future also set the stage for the challenges on the debt, government spending and economic growth that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insists the Trump administration can fix.  Bessent has advocated for a “3-3-3” plan, which involves getting the federal budget deficit down to 3% of GDP, boosting inflation-adjusted annual GDP growth to 3% and producing the equivalent of an additional 3 million barrels of oil per day by 2028. The treasury secretary has sought to discredit CBO scoring, calling it “crazy.” “I was in the investment business for 35 years, I thought I understood how crazy CBO scoring is,” Bessent told CNBC earlier this month. “And now that I’m on the other side of the wall, I can tell you it’s really crazy. And very unlikely that we are going to get any credit in the CBO scoring for tariffs.” However, CBO warnings about population growth cut into Trump administration policy priorities related to mass deportations, as officials claim that immigrants are fueling high inflation by worsening the housing shortage and depriving U.S. citizens of job opportunities. A decreasing population could have profoundnegative effects on the economy, as growth depends on adding workers as well as increasing their productivity. Falling population levels could cause a stagnation in living standards and create difficulties in paying down debts as well as funding programs such as Social Security, which is dependent on payroll taxes. The report also comes as the U.S. ison track to hit its statutory debt ceiling— the so-called X-date when the country runs short of money to pay its bills — as early as August without a deal between Congress and the White House. The CBO and the Bipartisan Policy Center this week detailed projections for the U.S. to hit its statutory debt ceiling sometime this summer — as soon as July or August, respectively. Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation —which among other things tracks the federal debt— said in a statement that “as bad as this outlook is, it represents an ‘optimistic scenario,’ because policymakers are currently considering adding trillions more in tax cut extensions, which would add to the debt.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

GameStop slumps as its plan to sell debt to fund bitcoin purchases raises some questions,https://apnews.com/article/gamestop-bitcoin-debt-stock-price-d916f8683c32e51b3c95abb340454f5a,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The sign hangs above the doorway into a GameStop store, June 11, 2024, in Lone Tree, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, file) GameStop shares sunk Thursday after its plan to sell debt in an effort to fund purchases of bitcoin raised some questions on Wall Street. The video game retailer announced a private offering of $1.3 billion in debt. The company said earlier this week that it plans to purchase bitcoin as a reserve asset. It will use proceeds from this debt offering to buy the cryptocurrency. The stock slumped 22.1%, marking a sharp reversal from Tuesday’s 11.7% gain. Trading in GameStop’s stock, which is often included with other so-called “meme” stocks, can be volatile. The debt offering comes at a big premium to the company’s value. It could also leave out a large portion of GameStop’s investors who wouldn’t qualify for the offering under certain investor requirements, according to a note from Wedbush led by analyst Michael Pachter. “We find it hard to understand why any investor would be pay more than two times cash value for the potential for GameStop to convert that cash into Bitcoin, particularly since the same investors can invest in Bitcoin or a Bitcoin ETF themselves,” he said in the note. The company has around $4.8 billion in cash and the conversion will bring its cash to $6.1 billion, he said. The stock is currently valued at about $12.7 billion. GameStop shares are down substantially from last May when influential investor Keith Gill, popularly known as “Roaring Kitty,′ appeared online for the first time in three years to declare his support for GameStop.  Gill helped ignite a “meme” stock craze in early 2021, when GameStop’s stock price soared above $120. “Despite a complete lack of articulated strategy, GameStop has consistently been able to capitalize on the existence of a ‘greater fool’ willing to pay more than twice its asset value for its shares, and so far, they’ve been right,” Pachter said. Even given their reservations about the note offering and bitcoin strategy, Wedbush analysts said in a separate note that they were “impressed” by GameStop’s ability to generate an operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2024 and “are more confident than we have been in the past that GameStop can achieve breakeven results for the foreseeable future.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Often the job of musaharati is passed from father to son. So everybody in the neighborhood knows him, and he knows them.

Technology is destroying our history and causing us to lose our identity,” said Fanas, who owns a toy store. He wanted to preserve the tradition of his father, “and God willing, my children will preserve it too.”  “The most beautiful thing is when I see the children happy to see me,” he said.

(Let’s Go Compost via AP)                 NEW YORK (AP) — Lauren Click founded a nonprofit a few years ago offering freecomposting educationto schools around the country. Today, 112 schools participate, yet she can’t get her boyfriend to properly separate his trash at home in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Adults have moreset behaviors than young kids.I try to model a behavior and hopefully he does it,” said Click, executive director of her Let’s Go Compost organization. “But it’s also like, I’m not his parent. I’m not going to berate him every day or ruin my relationship over this. I just fish a bunch of stuff out of the trash.” Her efforts, which she calls 50-50 effective with her partner, point to an important question in the field of environmental psychology: What’sthe best approachwhen looking toinfluence colleagues, friends and family to live more sustainably? What’s the worst? Researchers say Click is on the right track. Modeling can work, though as with other approaches, it depends on who the sender is, how the message is framed and who it’s intended for. Here’s a look at some of the issues and strategies involved in making people more aware of their role inclimate change, which is caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline, coal and gas, and encouraging them to cut waste and protect the natural world.  Magnus Bergquist is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. His research focuses on how to persuade people to adopt more eco-friendly behavior. In a recent study reviewing studies in his area, Bergquist homed in on the influence of others. “What we found was the most effective strategy for changing behavior is social norms, pointing to what other people are doing or people’s perception of other people’s approval or disapproval,” he said. “But interestingly, when we ask people about the effectiveness of different interventions, people tend to say that social norms are among the least effective ones,” Bergquist added. The bottom line: Humans are generally social animals, which isn’t a surprise. But most people underestimate how much they’re influenced by social norms, and campaigns are often based on strategies that are less effective, he said. While Click is unlikely to pay off her boyfriend to do better, Bergquist saidfinancial incentivesor disincentives are the second most effective strategy (behind social norms) in getting people to take more sustainable steps in their lives. That covers everything from bonus cash in a community or office totax benefits, he said. But there’s a caveat. When people change their behavior because of financial incentives or disincentives, “some studies show that it crowds out people’s moral compass,” he said. “They will do it for the money. They won’t do it for the sake of the question as such.” Example: A popular way to promote pro-environmental behavior is holding a contest for something like conserving energy or riding your bike to work. “Ride your bike and a get a prize,” Bergquist explained. “What we see over and over again is that’s effective in the short term. When the prize or the contest is removed, people tend to go back.” Norah Hippolyte is the business manager for St. Mary Magdalen Parish in socially progressive Berkeley, California. She supplies table goods for workers and a wide range of group gatherings, from funerals and community dinners to functions for the parish’s school. For several years, she’s been trying to wean everyone ontocompostable plates, cups, bowls and utensils. “So I buy the stuff. I make sure people are aware I’ve got it in the closet, that that’s where I keep everything. I say, use this stuff. Make sure you let me know when people start to run low,” she said. “But people choose not to use what’s there. They’re using their own things, and it’s all regular plastic.” She tries to get them to rinse and recycle, or clean what’s cleanable so it can be used again. “When I started working in Berkeley, I figured everybody had this whole recycle thing down. Nooooo,” Hippolyte said. “Not only did I have to learn, I have to now try and teach people, OK, this bin is for this, this and this. That bin is for this. Sorting is the biggest issue.” Hippolyte’s experience doesn’t surprise Bergquist. “I always want to mention education — trying to inform people or educate people about issues — because that tends to be ineffective alone,” he said. Bergquist says those who have been talking themselves to death or shoveling facts into the faces of reluctant folks should add some other motivation. For example, when Sarah Davies was trying to convince her 16-year-old son to give up single-use plastics, she switched strategies. “He truly believed he canuse plastic as much as he likesand then put it into the recycling bin,” said Davies, who heads up communications for Earthday.org, organizers of the April 22Earth Day. “What finally made the difference was me explaining that when he’s drinking from a single-use plastic bottle, be it water or soda, he’s also drinking potentially 240,000 nanoparticles of plastics. That shocked him.” Bergquist noted that a couple of experiments have indicated that people pay more attention to negative information than positive information. “So instead of saying many people are pro-environmental, you can say people are avoiding environmentally harmful products,” he said. “It’s the avoidance.” It’s a small but potentially valuable tweak, Bergquist said. Take straws. “Instead of saying people are using paper straws, you might say most people areavoiding plastic straws. You don’t have to explain. People will find an explanation,” he said. Other expert tips for persuasion include picking your battles; starting small, focusing on one habit; appealing to the person’s interest in other benefits, like saving money or being more efficient; keeping it easy; and not forcing the issue.

(Lilley Family via AP)                           The head of the Federal Aviation Administration told Congress during a hearing Thursday about a midair collision over Washington, D.C.,that killed 67 peoplethat the agency must do more to ensure flying remains safe. The FAA’s artificial intelligence-led review aimed at identifying safety threats at other airports with similar helicopter-airplane congestion should be finished in a couple weeks, said Chris Rocheleau, the agency’s acting administrator. During the hearing, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board and members of Congress again questioned how the FAA hadn’t noticed analarming number of close callsnear Ronald Reagan National Airport and addressed the problem before the January collision between an Army helicopter and a jetliner. Thecollision over the Potomac Riverwas the nation’s deadliest plane crashsince November 2001. “We have to do better,” Rocheleau said. “We have to identify trends, we have to get smarter about how we use data, and when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them.” The FAA is using AI to dig into the millions of reports it collects to assess other places with busy helicopter traffic including: Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and along the Gulf Coast. Rocheleau promised to take immediate action if risks are found. Investigators havehighlighted 85 close callsaround Reagan airport in the three years before the crash that should have signaled a growing safety problem. Rocheleau told the aviation subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that every close call is investigated and all the data was reviewed before, but this alarming trend was missed.  NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said there clearly was an issue with identifying trends in the data the FAA collects. Dailey Crofton, whose brother Casey Crofton died in the collision, attended the hearing. “I was surprised at the lapses of safety protocols that led to this crash,” he said in a statement afterward. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he learned that the Secret Service and U.S. Navy triggered a rash of collision alarms in planes around Reagan Airport on March 1 while testing anti-drone technology that used a similar frequency to the one used by planes’ warning systems. Cruz said that happened despite a warning from the FAA against doing it. “This is deeply disturbing that just a month after 67 people died while on approach to DCA (Reagan Airport), that the Secret Service and Pentagon would inadvertently cause multiple flights to receive urgent cockpit alerts recommending evasive action,” Cruz said. Helicopter traffic around Reagan National has been restricted since January any time planes use the same runway the American Airlines plane that crashed was approaching when it collided with the helicopter. At the NTSB’s urging, the FAApermanently bannedthat particular helicopter route under most circumstances. If a helicopter does use the route, planes are prohibited from taking off or landing on that runway. The U.S. Army’s head of aviation Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman acknowledged that as of Thursday morning helicopters were still flying over the nation’s capital with a key system broadcasting their locations turned off during most missions because it deemed them sensitive. Cruz called this “shocking and deeply unacceptable.” Rocheleau then said the FAA will immediately require all aircraft flying near Reagan National to broadcast their locations. The “ADS-B out data” is designed to help air traffic controllers better track an aircraft’s location with position updates every second.. Before that announcement, exceptions in the airspace above Washington allowed Army and other government aircraft to fly without transmitting, or fly in a mode that allowed less information to be transmitted to avoid broadcasting potentially sensitive missions to the public. Former Black Hawk pilot Tim Lilley, father of airliner copilot Sam Lilley, said he’s disappointed that the Army has not taken simple steps to improve safety he recommended in a meeting with Braman, including turning on the locator systems, adding a fourth crew member or barring the use of older Black Hawks on routes around Washington. “I was frustrated with the lack of accountability. The Army still doesn’t want to say that they did anything wrong,” said Lilley, who flew helicopter routes around the capital for four years in the 1990s as part of a 20-year Army career and now flies private jets. Homendy also noted that it is important to inspect the transmission equipment to make sure it actually works. The helicopter involved in this collision had not transmitted any location data for 730 days. When the NTSB checked the rest of the unit’s helicopters after the crash, it found eight of them that hadn’t transmitted since 2023. Plus, Homendy said she’s not sure what the Army was doing with any close call reports it received or how closely it was monitoring whether its helicopters violated altitude limits during their flights like the one that collided with the jetliner did. She said most of the safety conversations at the battalion level were focused on “OSHA slips, trips and falls.” Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report from Washington D.C.

He was referring to emerging news reports & was not confirming the fate of the missing, which is still unknown.” The U.S. Army said the Hercules armored vehicle the four U.S. soldiers were in during a training exercise had been found submerged in a body of water. It said recovery efforts were underway by U.S. Army and Lithuanian Armed Forces and civilian agencies. The soldiers, all from 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, were conducting tactical training when they went missing. Asked Wednesday evening by reporters if he had been briefed about the missing soldiers, President Donald Trump said, “No, I haven’t.” During a trip to Warsaw, Rutte told reporters that he had received word of the deaths of the four soldiers while he wasdelivering a lecture,and that his thoughts were with their families and with the United States. “This is still early news so we do not know the details. This is really terrible news and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones,” Rutte said in Warsaw.  Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that the four U.S. soldiers and their vehicle were reported missing Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Belarus.

All Rights Reserved. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese smiles at the end of a press conference in Sydney, July 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File) MEBOURNE, Australia (AP) —Anthony Albanesehopes to become the first Australian prime minister in 21 years to lead a political party to two consecutive election victories. The last was John Howard, who won a fourth consecutive term in 2004, making him the second-longest serving leader in Australia’s history. But when he was voted out three years later, it marked the beginning of a turbulent period in Australian politics with six prime ministers. Albanese, 62, came fromhumble circumstances, the only child of a single mother who became an invalid pensioner. They lived in public housing in Sydney. Albanese’s election pledge has been that his government would hold no Australian back and leave none behind. A first priority of his government was to hold a referendum in 2023 that would have enshrined in the constitution an Indigenous body known as theVoiceto advise Parliament on issues that effect Indigenous lives. Indigenous Australians account for 4% of the population and are the nation’s most disadvantaged ethnic minority. The referendum was defeated and the government was accused by critics of focusing on a minority group instead of the needs of the majority during an inflation crisis.  Albanese, who is divorced and has an adult son, was to become the first Australian prime minister to marry in office after he proposed to his fiancee Jodie Haydon on Valentine’s Day last year. The couple initially planned to marry before the election, but Labor strategists feared a wedding during a cost of living crisis could hurt his re-election chances. Albanese now says it will happen after the election, but before the end of the year. He has been accused of focusing too much on life after politics by buying awaterside houselast year at Copacabana Beach, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Sydney. It’s a region where Haydon grew up and where three generations of her family still live. The 4.3 million Australian dollar price ($2.7 million) price tag for the four-bedroom, clifftop home has been highlighted in the news media as many Australians struggle with a shortage of affordable housing. “I understand I’m fortunate. I also know what it is like to struggle,” Albanese said of his new home. Prime Minister John Howard was voted out after 11 years in 2007, in an election that marked the start of a newera of instabilityin Australian politics. Since then, it’s been a revolving door for prime ministers. Since Howard, six people have held the job — including one, the current Australian Ambassador to the United StatesKevin Rudd, who held it twice in separate stints three years apart. Most of those who led their parties to election victories were dumped by their own parties between votes in the face of poor opinion polling. The only leader to serve a full three-year term was Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who replaced ousted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull nine months before the 2019 election and remained in office until his government was defeated by Albanese in 2022. That leaves Albanese with a chance to become the first prime minister since Howard to win back-to-back elections. Albanese’s durability could be explained in part by a change of center-left Labor Party’s rules that make dumping a sitting prime minister more difficult. When Rudd returned to the helm a second time in 2013, he got his party to tighten the rules for switching leader. A ballot for a new prime minister now requires the support of 75% of Labor lawmakers instead of a simple majority. Party members who pay a membership fee but don’t hold elected offices also have a say in the result. Rudd had surrendered his prime ministership in 2010, just a few hours after his deputy Julia Gillard challenged his leadership. Close advisers including Albanese, then a Cabinet minister, assured him he had no chance of winning a ballot of government lawmakers the next day. Gillard was elected unopposed by her government colleagues to replace Rudd. She led her party through an election, and lasted until she attempted to crush internal grumblings about her leadership in 2013 by inviting any of her colleagues to challenge her in a snap ballot the same day. Rudd accepted her challenge and won that ballot 57 votes to 45. Rudd’s changes made overthrowing a leader into a slower process that takes weeks and wider consultation beyond the Parliament. The conservative Liberal Party, which is in opposition, has also tightened their rules since their lawmakers lastdumped a prime ministerin 2018.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah, File) DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa’s Republican attorney general is suing a county sheriff over his Facebook post saying his department doesn’t always need to detain people at the request of federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit filed late Wednesday jeopardizes state funding to the county in northeast Iowa, home to about 20,000 residents, and comes amid PresidentDonald Trump’s campaign of mass deportations. The state attorney general’s investigation showed the sheriff’s office has responded appropriately to each of the nearly two dozen requests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since 2018 to hold someone suspected of immigration violations. However, the suit alleges the sheriff violated Iowa law because his Facebook post discouraged cooperation with federal immigration officers. Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx’s post was deleted Thursday afternoon, hours after the lawsuit was filed late Wednesday. Attorney General Brenna Bird said in a statement Thursday that Marx refused to meet the deadline given to remedy the issue. Marx, a Republican, told constituents on Feb. 4 that he shares some of their “mistrust and many of your concerns with the legitimacy of how these federal agents conduct business” and that requests to hold individuals without a court order are “violations” of constitutional rights. The attorney general’s lawsuit says some of the claims Marx made in his post were knowingly wrong. Those claims “impeded and discouraged cooperation with federal immigration authorities,” which is against the law in Iowa.  Iowa’s Republican lawmakers and governor advanced a law in 2018 to ensure cities and counties fully comply with federal immigration law, prohibiting “sanctuary cities” that generally limit cooperation with immigration authorities. There is a renewed push in states across the country tosupport Trump’s immigration efforts, includinglegislative proposalsto increase fines or other penalties for local officials that violate such laws. Marx and County Attorney Andrew Van Der Maaten did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Thursday on the court filing. A new Facebook post Thursday from the sheriff’s office said they deleted the February post “to demonstrate good faith,” but that they “disagree with the Attorney General’s conclusion” that the original post broke the law. Still, the sheriff’s office reiterated its “commitment to remain in compliance with State and Federal immigration laws while staying true to the Constitutional protections afforded the citizens of Winneshiek County.” That new statement did not satisfy the attorney general’s requirements for Marx to remedy his violation of Iowa law, spokesperson Alyssa Broulliet told The Associated Press. Marx had been informed Wednesday morning of the 5 p.m. deadline, the attorney general’s office said. The Trump administration has also beguntaking legal action against governmentsthat have adopted policies inhibiting ICE arrests and deportations. The Department of Justice has sued Illinois, Chicago and Cook County, alleging they are violating federal law by not cooperating with immigration authorities. Marx’s February post echoed critiques ofso-called ICE “detainer” requeststhat ask local or state enforcement agencies to hold individuals until they can be taken into custody by federal authorities. Marx said those requests often clash with the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which bars against unreasonable searches and seizures of individuals without a warrant based on probable cause. If federal agents’ “actions or paperwork are not within constitutional parameters,” he wrote, “then we will make every effort to block, interfere and interrupt their actions from moving forward.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Puskar) BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Sidney Crosby’s career-long point-per-game consistency has broken an NHL record he shared with Wayne Gretzky. By scoring 8:49 into the first period for Pittsburgh against Buffalo on Thursday night, Crosby registered his 80th point to assure he’ll finish his 20th NHL season averaging at least a point per outing. The Penguins captain surpassed the mark first set by Gretzky, who finished all but his 20th and final NHL season in 1998-99 averaging a point a game. The 37-year-old Crosby reached 80 points in his 72nd game in a season during which he has already missed two outings due to injury. Pittsburgh has eight games remaining on its schedule. Crosby’s 26th goal of the season cut Buffalo’s lead to 2-1. He was set up by Rickard Rakell’s pass from below the goal-line to the left of the net. Crosby used his right skate to stop the pass and kick into his stick before snapping it inside the right post. Selected first overall in the 2005 draft, Crosby has spent his entire career in Pittsburgh, where he’s a three-time Stanley Cup champion. Meanwhile, Washington’s Alex Ovechkin is closing in on breaking Gretzky’s NHL career record of 894 career goals. Ovechkin scored his 889th goal Tuesday night.

All Rights Reserved. A Sundance festivalgoer walks past the Egyptian Theatre during the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 25, 2025, in Park City, Utah. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File) PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — The Sundance Film Festival announced Thursday thatits new homewill be Boulder, Colorado, starting in 2027, after spending 40 years in Park City, Utah. The decision ends a yearlong process in which numerous U.S. cities vied to host the prominent independent film festival, which has been a launching pad for numerous directors, actors and Oscar contenders. The finalist cities ended up being Boulder, Cincinnati, Ohio, and a combined Salt Lake City and Park City bid. Sundance’s new home of Boulder even has a connection to its founder,Robert Redford,who attended the university there in the 1950s. Here are some of the reactions to Sundance’s upcoming move: “Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.” — Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement. “As I’ve said from the beginning, we wanted Sundance to stay. We made that clear to their leadership and put together a highly competitive package. Ultimately, this decision is theirs to make, but I believe it’s a mistake and that, one day, they’ll realize they left behind not just a place, but their heritage.” — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, in a statement. “The Sundance Film Festival is a catalyst for innovation, creative expression, and the discovery of groundbreaking independent films that inspire and shape the future of storytelling. This process provided the opportunity to imagine how we design the Festival while staying true to our programming and mission.” Acting Sundance CEO Amanda Kelso, in a statement.  “This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.” — Redford, in a statement. “While we are naturally disappointed by the decision, the State of Utah, Park City and Salt Lake City have long been proud partners of the Festival, and we are grateful for the lasting impact it has had on our communities. We remain committed to fostering the arts right here in Utah, where the spirit of storytelling will always thrive.” — a joint statement from the mayors of Park City, Salt Lake City and Utah Film Commission. “While Cincinnati was not selected to host the Sundance Film Festival, we are proud of how our city demonstrated its dynamic role within the film industry,” Film Cincinnati President Kristen Schlotman said in a statement.

"A new Chili’s near Scranton will be a throwback to ‘The Office,’ ‘awesome blossom’ and all",https://apnews.com/article/office-chilis-scranton-2faea0e7841dcd6903a798064fd17508,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Chili’s is opening a new restaurant just north of Scranton to honor the legacy of the show, “The Office.” The new Chili’s will have a mid-2000s theme and will bring back the “awesome blossom,” an onion dish celebrated on the show but long discontinued by the chain. It has been nearly two decades since the workplace mockumentary“The Office”first set an episode inside a Chili’s, where Michael Scott handed out Dundie awards to his ever-tolerant employees, including trophies for the whitest sneakers and for stinking up the bathroom. Over nine seasons, “The Office” regularly name-dropped real places and products associated with Scranton, where the Emmy-winning show was set. There’s the big pirate ship restaurant known as Cooper’s Seafood House and Poor Richard’s Pub inside a bowling alley. But in 2005, there was no Chili’s in the Pennsylvania city. So, at last, the chain is filling a hole in Office lore by opening a Chili’s in Dickson City, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) north of Scranton. This undated photo provided by Chili’s, shows actors Brian Baumgartner, left, who played Kevin Malone, and Kate Flannery, who played Meredith Palmer in the TV series “The Office,” posing in a soon-to-be opened Chili’s in Dickson City, Pa. (Ben Rosenzweig, Chili’s via AP)  The restaurant will be decorated as it would have been in the mid-2000s with old signs and chalkboard art. It will also feature direct nods to the show’s fictitious paper company, Dunder Mifflin. In one episode, Scott, played by Steve Carell, orders an awesome blossom — a deep-fried onion with a cheese dipping sauce — while trying to win a new client over lunch at Chili’s. That item, long struck from the Chili’s menu nationwide, is being reintroduced in the Scranton-area restaurant only. The new Chili’s will open April 7, when a “Scranton marg” will be available nationwide for the day. Two Office actors are appearing in commercials for the restaurant: Brian Baumgartner, who played the dimwitted accountant Kevin Malone; and Kate Flannery, whose character Meredith Palmer was a party-loving divorced mother working in supplier relations. Other actors, including Melora Hardin, Andy Buckley and Amy Pietz, also feature in a promotional video. “It seems like a wrong was righted here at around the 20th anniversary of the show to finally have a Scranton branch of Chili’s,” Baumgartner told The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Decades ago, when word got out that an American version of the British show “The Office” would center on Scranton, some locals feared their hometown would be the butt of the joke. The Rust Belt town had its heyday generations earlier with anthracite coal mining and steam trains. The show wound up celebrating Scranton and the characters, not poking fun at them, Baumgartner said. A life-sized Dundie Award is displayed in Scranton City Hall’s entryway, Tuesday, March 25, 2025, in Scranton, Pa. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Flannery, who is from Philadelphia, said she’s happy “The Office” helped to reinforce local pride in the city. Scranton has hostedlarge Office parties, including one that drew many cast members and some 10,000 people around the 2013 series finale. Streaming services have boosted the show’s popularity. “It’s kind of like what Pam Beesly says in the last episode: there’s beauty in ordinary things. And Scranton can feel ordinary to some people,” Flannery told the AP. “But it’s really special. It really is.” The show banked on residents and businesses to donate Scranton swag, and gave shout-outs to local landmarks. John Krasinski, who played Jim Halpert, filmed scenes for the opening montage in Scranton, making the city’s Penn Paper tower recognizable around the world. The “Scranton welcomes you” sign from Krasinski’s footage was moved to a downtown mall because people kept stopping on a highway to take photos.

(Chili’s via AP)  For Chili’s, building a themed eatery that is expected to draw tourists isn’t the normal course of business, said George Felix, Chili’s chief marketing officer. In 2005, the nearest Chili’s was about 19 miles (30 kilometers) away from Scranton. It has since closed. “Given the ties that this brand has to Scranton, this one was definitely special for us,” Felix told the AP. Baumgartner, who analyzed the show in a podcast and book, said the new Chili’s calls back to a crucial episode — The Dundies — that kicked off Season 2, Baumgartner said. “We were a failing show, quite frankly, with really bad ratings that first season and barely got brought back for a second,” Baumgartner said. “But some tonal things were changed. We decided to open that second season with kind of a bang, and left the office for the first time.” In that episode, Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, won the “whitest sneakers” Dundie and declared tipsily, “I feel God in this Chili’s tonight.” Pam was subsequently banned from Chili’s nationwide for stealing people’s drinks. In 2017, Chili’s pardoned the character, saying she was welcome back. “It’s going to feel like they’re actually on the show because it’s going to look exactly the same,” Flannery said of the Scranton-area Chili’s. “So it’s like a fan destination. It’s kind of awesome.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
Civil rights groups say push to dismantle Education Department will undo hard-won gains,https://apnews.com/article/trump-department-of-education-closure-civil-rights-4c5f4e8347dd3318d2f23ad8632d7b74,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Dozens of people gather in downtown Niles, Mich., Thursday, March 20, 2025, to protest recent government cuts in the Department of Education. (Don Campbell/The Herald-Palladium via AP)         WASHINGTON (AP) — The rights of Americans to self-determine how to educate their children — a hotly contested matter that stretches back to at least the Civil War — have long been intertwined with the principle of equally and equitably educating children across racial lines. When President Donald Trump last weeksigned an executive orderto dismantle the U.S. Education Department, he declared that“the experiment of controlling American education through federal programs and dollars … has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.” By doing so, he reopened a debate in the fight overthe federal government’s rolein education policy. Civil rights advocates see Trump’s order to shutter the department as a broadside againsthard-fought gains in educational access— an unfinished, but nonetheless central, part of the movement for racial equality and greater democracy. Supporters of the president’s plans, however, see it as a step toward providing more local control and higher quality educational opportunities for different communities. Now, a coalition of civil rights and education groups, including the NAACP and the National Education Association, have filed a lawsuit against Trump’s order shuttering the Education Department, arguing that the administration’s cuts to the agency’s staff will hobble mandated functions like protecting students from discrimination or funding educational programs. The coalition argues the order is unconstitutional because it must be done by Congress, who created the department in 1979. They further argue that communities of color, disabled people, low-income students and some educators would have no recourse against civil rights violations in schools if the department was closed. The Trump administration hasmade antisemitism cases the priorityfor the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which investigates discrimination complaints in schools. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has suggested the civil rights office could move over to the Justice Department. Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement that the White House’s argument that abolishing the department would empower states and localities to better respond to their respective communities is a “fabricated justification” that “harkens back to a period of legalized school segregation.” Members of Congress and liberal legal groups have also promised action in response to the order. Rep. Jahana Hayes, a former school teacher, introduced a bill in Congress that would invest in the department and reverse Trump’s order, which the Connecticut Democrat called “incoherent” given the administration’s priorities on government efficiency. The legislation is unlikely to advance in the Republican-led House, but it highlights Democrats’ messaging on the issue. Michael Pillera, a former Education Department senior civil rights attorney, argued that Trump’s order “will destroy civil rights guardrails that ensure educational opportunity for all students — and shatter educational opportunity for Black students and other students of color in particular.” Advocates of school choice, however, view the executive order as a key step in enabling communities to more nimbly respond to the needs of different students. School choice is a broad term that describes policies that help families pursue alternatives to neighborhood public schools, including charter schools, homeschooling, and taxpayer-funded vouchers for private schools. Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy organization, said in a statement that Trump’s order “will have both brought down a failed bureaucratic machine in DC, and brought school choice to every state.” Advocates of school choice often point to low-performing public schools, measured by test scores and other student outcomes, as a reason that school systems should be subject to greater market forces. But many civil rights groups and educators say such policies only benefit wealthy or privileged students and would worsen many of the problems school choice advocates say they aim to address. “We all know that we need to do more to improve our schools, especially for those routinely denied an excellent education,” Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. But Trump’s order, Wiley argued, “is a direct attack on schools and the right to an education.” The department, Wiley said, should be improved for the sake of Black families who may feel the worst effects of its closure: “Fix it, don’t nix it, because it is the place parents can go to hold their schools accountable for delivering services and ensuring schools are meeting their obligations to use federal dollars as intended.” The first U.S. Department of Education was founded in 1867 as a hub to survey and improve American education, which happened amid the country’s Reconstruction era, the 12-year period after the Civil War when the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments were adopted to push to unify and advance the country. The agency only lasted a year before it was rolled into the Interior Department amid pushback from anti-Reconstruction Southern politicians and white supremacist vigilantes who associated any federal oversight with empowering freedmen, the country’s formerly enslaved people of African descent. A standalone department with a mandate to improve education wasn’t reestablished until over a century later by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Education has long been foundational to the debate over civil rights and democracy. Formerly enslaved people, who were banned by law from receiving an education, immediately organized for schools to become literate and trained in vocations in a bid for self-determination. Historically Black colleges and universities were central to improving Black economic power and served as incubators for the Civil Rights movement. The fight against school segregation was an integral chapter during America’s Jim Crow era. School segregation was premised on the idea that educational systems could be “separate but equal,” or that Black students could receive a similar quality education despite states and localities explicitly discriminating against them. The Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education found that school segregation had a “detrimental effect” on Black students, implied the “inferiority” of Black communities, and was thus unconstitutional. The court also acknowledged that because education is handled by states and local governments, there would be “considerable complexity” in enacting its ruling. The decision kicked off decades of debates over discrimination and educational access in communities across the nation. The Education Department has, since its creation 25 years after the landmark ruling, taken on a central role in mediating disputes and enforcing civil rights laws across the country. The administration has pushed back on concerns that the closure of the department would end crucial funding, despite some calls from Republican lawmakers to overhaul or downsize many such programs. Republican lawmakers have long argued that the federal government has no role in education policy and conservative activists, emboldened by a crisis in education after the COVID-19 pandemic, have gained momentum by portraying public education and the Education Department as overbearing and ineffective. McMahon has said she will remove red tape and empower states to decide what’s best for their schools. She has also promised to continue essential services like those for students with disabilities. But some Black educators are now concerned that the department’s closure may weaken education in marginalized communities, which have traditionally turned to schools as a way to ensure upward mobility and political power. “I think it’s very dangerous to totally rely on states’ rights,” said Sharif El-Mekki, a former principal and founder of the Center for Black Educator Development, a non-profit that recruits Black teachers. “Because too often, states’ rights in the past have meant the state had the right to harm who they chose, to leave children behind, and often their right to choose less support on the backs of Black, brown, Indigenous and immigrant students.” ___   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kenya Hunter)             WASHINGTON (AP) — In a major overhaul,the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serviceswill lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the country. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient “sprawling bureaucracy” in a video announcing the restructuring Thursday. He faulted the department’s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans’ health. “I want to promise you now that we’re going to do more with less,” Kennedy said in the video, posted to social media. The restructuring plan caps weeks of tumult at the nation’s top health department, which has been embroiled inrumors of mass firings, the revocation of$11 billion in public health fundingfor cities and counties,a tepid responseto a measles outbreak, and controversial remarks about vaccines from its new leader. Still, Kennedy said a “painful period” lies ahead for HHS, which is responsible for monitoring infectious diseases, inspecting foods and hospitals, and overseeing health insurance programs for nearly half the country. Overall, the department will downsize to 62,000 positions, losing nearly a quarter of its staff — 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers encouraged by President Donald Trump’s administration.  The staffing cuts were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Public health experts, doctors, current and former HHS workers and congressional Democrats quickly panned Kennedy’s plans, warning they could have untold consequences for millions of people. “These staff cuts endanger public health and food safety,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, in a statement. “They raise serious concerns that the administration’s pledge to make Americans healthy again could become nothing more than an empty promise.” But Kennedy, in announcing the restructuring, blasted HHS for failing to improve Americans’ lifespans and not doing enough to drive down chronic disease and cancer rates. “All of that money,” Kennedy said of the department’s $1.7 trillion yearly budget, “has failed to improve the health of Americans.” Cancer death rates have dropped 34% over the past two decades, translating to 4.5 million deaths avoided, according to the American Cancer Society. That’s largely due to smoking cessation, the development of better treatments — many funded by the National Institutes of Health, including groundbreaking immunotherapy — and earlier detection. The reorganization plan also underscores Kennedy’s push to take more control of the public health agencies — the NIH, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which have traditionally operated with a level of autonomy from the health secretary. Under the plan, external communications, procurement, information technology and human resources will be centralized under HHS. Federal health workers — stationed across the country at agencies including at the NIH and FDA, both in Maryland — described shock, fear and anxiety rippling through their offices Thursday. Workers were not given advance notice of the cuts, several told The Associated Press, and many remained uncertain about whether their jobs were on the chopping block. “It’s incredibly difficult and frustrating and upsetting to not really know where we stand while we’re trying to keep doing the work,” said an FDA staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “We’re being villainized and handicapped and have this guillotine just hanging over our necks.” HHS on Thursday provided a breakdown of some of the cuts. __ 3,500 jobs at the FDA, which inspects and sets safety standards for medications, medical devices and foods. __ 2,400 jobs at the CDC, which monitors for infectious disease outbreaks and works with public health agencies nationwide. __ 1,200 jobs at the NIH, the world’s leading public health research arm. __ 300 jobs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Affordable Care Act marketplace, Medicare and Medicaid. HHS said it anticipates the changes will save $1.8 billion per year but didn’t give a breakdown or other details. The cuts and consolidation go far deeper than anyone expected, an NIH employee said. “We’re all pretty devastated,” said the staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We don’t know what this means for public health.” Union leaders for CDC workers in Atlanta said they received notice from HHS on Thursday morning that reductions will focus on administrative positions including human resources, finance, procurement and information technology. At CMS, where cuts focus on workers who troubleshoot problems that arise for Medicare beneficiaries and Affordable Care Act enrollees, the result will be the “lowest customer service standards” for thousands of cases, said Jeffrey Grant, a former deputy director at the agency who resigned last month. Beyond losing workers, Kennedy said he will shut down entire agencies, some of which were established by Congress decades ago. Several will be folded into a new Administration for a Healthy America, he said. Those include the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees and provides funding for hundreds of community health centers around the country, as well as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which funds clinics and overseesthe national 988 hotline. Both agencies pump billions of dollars into on-the-ground work in local communities. SAMHSA was created by Congress in 1992, so closing it is illegal and raises questions about Kennedy’s commitment to treating addiction and mental health, said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University addiction researcher. “Burying the agency in an administrative blob with no clear purpose is not the way to highlight the problem or coordinate a response,” Humphreys said. The Administration for Healthy America will focus on maternal and child health, environmental health and HIV/AIDS work, HHS said. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, created by a law signed by then-Republican President George W. Bush and responsible for maintaining the national stockpile that was quickly drained during the COVID-19 pandemic, will also be eliminated and moved into the CDC. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said the ramifications of Kennedy’s plans for HHS are unclear. “We’ll just wait and see what it is, and then we’ll go back and try to fix if there is something broken,” Rounds said. “That’s the approach we’ve taken so far.” But Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington warned that the fallout is clear. “It does not take a genius to understand that pushing out 20,000 workers at our preeminent health agencies won’t make Americans healthier,” Murray said in a statement. “It’ll just mean fewer health services for our communities, more opportunities for disease to spread, and longer waits for lifesaving treatments and cures.” Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone and Lauran Neergaard in Washington; JoNel Aleccia in Temecula, Calif.; Carla K.

(AP Photo/Janie Har, File)            Up until 2020, Anna Wong had gone her entire adulthood in Los Angeles without ever facing blatantly racist abuse for being Asian. After COVID-19 hit, she was accosted twice in six months. The first time, she was browsing an aisle in Bed Bath & Beyond when a white, 30-something woman suddenly yelled: “Six feet away from me, you Chinese witch!” A shaken Wong left the store, the woman still yelling after her. The second time, Wong was walking her dog when a passenger in a car — a young Hispanic man — screamed at her “Thanks for ruining the world,” followed by an ethnic slur. “The first, second year of the pandemic, I do distinctly remember thinking ... I was very nervous to go out,” said Wong, who did not report the incidents to police. “Am I going to draw attention to the fact that I’m Asian?” It seemed unfathomable she was facing such anti-Asian vitriol nearly a century after her aunt, pioneering movie star Anna May Wong, dealt with constant racial discrimination. It was five years ago this month that pandemic-fueled abuse of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders became so frequent — reports spiked 35% from March 2020 to the end of 2021 — that a reporting center was formed. Stop AAPI Hate legitimized fears of a concurrent pandemic of xenophobia. The group’s data prompted national legislative action, including the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, and galvanized advocacy among young people within the Asian American community.  Five years later, Stop AAPI Hate is receiving fewer incident reports yearly but they’re still happening by the hundreds and are likely an undercount. Now, those still fighting anti-Asian hate are worried it will only intensify in a political climate ofimmigration crackdowns,English-only mandatesandbans on DEI initiatives. During President Donald Trump’s first term, many partially blamed him for framingCOVID-19 with racist language. Trump said his remarks were “not racist at all.” Now, there is concern not just about hate but erasure of Asian American and Pacific Islander history and culture. For example, this month the Pentagon mistakenly took downweb pages honoring Japanese American servicemen. “What’s the opposite of diversity? It’s segregation or re-segregation,” Manjusha Kulkarni, Stop AAPI Hate co-founder, said, referring to Trump’s policies so far. “They want to put us — people of color, women, LGBTQ — sort of back in our ‘place,’ which means not with access to jobs or housing or ability to celebrate our holidays.” Kulkarni, executive director of the AAPI Equity Alliance, Cynthia Choi of Chinese for Affirmative Action, and San Francisco State University professor Russell Jeung came together in 2020 after a Los Angeles teen of Asian descent was assaulted at school. They solicited accounts of hate acts from victims, even those not legally hate crimes. They received a barrage. “The first thing we need to know and understand is how big of a problem is this,” Kulkarni said, adding that she will be eternally grateful that people responded. “That helped us to know what was going on.” Besides federal hate crimes legislation, Stop AAPI Hate’s data led to the passing of three California bills. These included expanding civil rights protection in public spaces and studying hate-driven harassment on public transit. They’ve also attempted social media campaigns like “Spread AAPI Love,” the opposite of their moniker. Even though the pandemic has abated, their data shows racism prevails. From March 2020 to the end of 2023, Stop AAPI Hate collected over 12,000 reports though they believe it’s likely an undercount. Over 700 occurred in 2023. Figures for 2024 will be released in May. Also in 2023, an AAPI Data and Associated Press-NORC poll founda third of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanderssay they have experienced an act of abuse based on their race or ethnicity in the last year. An FBI analysis from that year found out of 7,049 reported hate crime offenses motivated by race, ethnicity or ancestry, 6.6% involved anti-Asian bias.Kash Patel, the first person of color and Asian American to be agency director, talked about being subjected to racism during his confirmation hearing. There was a groundswell of Asian American activism after 2020, according to Stop AAPI Hate. Their 2023 report found nearly 3 in 4 Asian American and Pacific Islander adults participated in activities to reduce or resist racism. William Diep, who was 16 in 2020, was disturbed by attacks he heard about in New York City. So he started a campaign, “Virus: Racism.” He virtually gathered testimonies from young people about anti-Asian encounters. The project deeply affected him. “I learned to stick up for people,” said Diep, now a senior at Columbia University. He wonders how advocates can navigate the current political climate and if government resources such as translations or race-based census research will be eliminated. “I’m scared that there’s no one to protect Asian Americans,” Diep said. “I think Asian Americans protect each other, but I question the infrastructure that exists to protect our rights and our heritage.” Stop AAPI Hate does rely on some federal funding. Ideally, neither the government nor any other outside force will be able to dictate or hamper the organization’s work. “We hope not. I mean, we’re fighting as hard as we can,” Kulkarni said. Now, the coalition’s focus has expanded to include educating people about issues like birthright citizenship, cultural school curriculum and immigrants’ rights. Some Asian legal U.S. residentssay they are being targeted for deportation. “I hope and strongly believe that our communities are stronger, that we’re more equipped to handle the challenges of today, which are even more significant than they were in 2020,” Kulkarni said. “We were built for this and our values remain the same.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)     NEW YORK (AP) — Relatives of a man who died when asightseeing helicopter crashed and sankin a New York City river have settled a lawsuit for $90 million, agreeing to reduce a jury award in order to foreclose appeals and end the case. Court records show a Manhattan judge approved the settlement Wednesday in the wrongful death case of Trevor Cadigan, seven years after he died at age 26. Last fall a Manhattan juryawarded $116 millionto Cadigan’s relatives, but defendants later took steps to challenge the award. The settlement stops those challenges, and Cadigan family lawyer Gary C. Robb said Thursday that his clients felt it was time to close the case. “Their primary objective was twofold, and that is, one, to ensure accountability for what happened to Trevor, and also to shine a bright light on dangerous helicopter operator practices and induce them to do a better, safer job,” Robb said by phone. “And they accomplished both objectives, we believe.” Messages seeking comment were sent to lawyers for defendants FlyNYON, which arranged the flight, and Liberty Helicopters, which owned the helicopter and supplied the pilot. Another defendant, flotation device maker Dart Aerospace, declined to comment. The aircraft, which had no doors, plunged into the East River after apassenger restraint tether snaggedon a floor-mounted fuel shutoff switch, stopping the engine, a the National Transportation Safety Board investigation found. The pilot was able to release his seatbelt and escape the sinking aircraft, but the five passengerswere trapped insafety harnesses.  Killed were Cadigan; his friend Brian McDaniel, 26; Carla Vallejos Blanco, 29; Tristan Hill, 29; and Daniel Thompson, 34. Cadigan, a journalist, had recently moved to New York from Dallas. After the crash the Federal Aviation Administrationtemporarily groundeddoors-off flights with tight seat restraints. Such flights later resumed with requirements for restraints that can be released with a single action.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Georgia Senate approves investigation of Democrat Stacey Abrams as Trump targets her,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-stacey-abrams-donald-trump-senate-investigation-493f456511fd43feed76dab2e6b529aa,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for Governor of Georgia, speaks to supporters on election night watch party at a hotel in Atlanta on Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2022. (Miguel Martinez/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP,File) ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s Republican-dominated state Senate is going forward with an investigation ofStacey Abrams, a move that comes as President Donald Trump has made a target of the two-time Democratic nominee for Georgia governor. Republican State Sen. Bill Cowsert of Athens said Thursday that he and other Republicans want to further examine recent ethics findings that voter participation group New Georgia Project improperly coordinated with Abrams’ 2018 campaign for governor. “We have developed somewhat of a problem these days with dark money in politics, with secret money being used to fund campaigns,” Cowsert said. “The whole purpose of our campaign finance laws is to put sunshine on the issues.” They also want to probe claims by new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin that $2 billion was improperly given to a coalition of groups trying to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Abrams worked with one of the groups until the end of last year, but Trump and other Republicans have made Abrams the face of their criticism of$20 billion in grantsawarded by former President Joe Biden’s administration, with Trump calling out Abrams in arecent joint addressto Congress. Senators voted 33-21 along party lines to approve the inquiry. The same Georgia committee has been pursuing a thus-far fruitless investigation of another Trump enemy, Fulton County District AttorneyFani Willis.  “We have already spent precious time investigating people for headlines and clicks, while providing taxpayers with little benefit,” said state Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat. Abrams has said that Republicans are targeting her because she’s been politically effective. The former state House minority leader, Abrams vaulted to national Democratic stardom when she came close to defeating Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2018. She parlayed voting rights after that election into a national platform and even consideration as Biden’s running mate in 2020, but lost a 2022 governor’s race rematch to Kemp by a broader margin. The resolution means the GOP-led Senate can conduct meetings scrutinizing a second high-profile Democrat as Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and several members of the investigatory committee consider running for office in 2026. Armed withsubpoena power, the committee has been trying to force Willis to testify about whether she did anything wrong in her investigation and prosecution of Trump and others. However, its efforts thus far have disclosed little that wasn’t already known about Willis and her hiring ofspecial prosecutor Nathan Wade, with whom she had aromantic relationship, to lead the prosecution against Trump and others. Abrams founded the New Georgia Project in 2013 to register more nonwhite and young voters in Georgia and to urge them to turn out. She stepped down in 2017 and said she had no role with the group thereafter. In January, the New Georgia Project and its affiliated New Georgia Project Action Fundadmitted that they brokeGeorgia’s campaign finance law by failing to register as an independent campaign committee and failing to disclose contributions and spending. The Ethics Commission fined the groups $300,000, the largest ethics fine in state history, mostly for violations that supported Abrams’ 2018 run for governor. The group has been in turmoil, laying off workers, some of whom said they were fired because they were trying to form a union. On Feb. 12, the Trump-appointed Zeldin called for the return of$2 billion grantedto Power Forward Communities in April 2024, part of $20 billion that Zeldin claimed was improperly granted by Biden’s administration. Abrams wassenior counselto Rewiring America until December. That’s one of the groups that made up the Power Forward Communities coalition. Abrams wasn’t paid by Power Forward Communities, spokesperson Joshua Karp has said. One of the other nonprofits that got $7 billion of the $20 billionhas sued the EPA, accusing it of improperly freezing a legally awarded grant. Climate United Fund, a coalition of three nonprofit groups, demanded access to a Citibank account it received through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program created in 2022 by theInflation Reduction Actand more commonly known as the green bank. In a related action, the Coalition for Green Capital, a separate group that received $5 billion from the Biden-era program, sued Citibank, alleging breach of contract over the refusal to disburse the grant funds.

(AP Photo/Beth Harris)        LOS ANGELES (AP) —Betty Whiteis making her mark on the nation’s snail mail. The beloved actor of “The Golden Girls” fame was celebrated with a new U.S. Postal Service stamp at a first-day-of-issue ceremony at the Los Angeles Zoo on Thursday. Fans that were crowded behind barricades cheered as a blue curtain dropped to reveal the stamp featuring a portrait of White against a violet-colored background with lighter shades of bubbly spots in a nod to her sparkling personality. She wears a blue polka-dot blouse and peeking out of her blond curls is an earring shaped like a pawprint. “When I was working on the stamp surrounding myself with Betty White videos and pictures, I felt like I was working on a portrait of a family member,” Boston-based artist Dale Stephanos said. “I wanted Betty’s huge personality to take center stage.” The illustration is based on a photo taken by Kwaku Alston in 2010. At the celebration, singer-songwriter Ellis Hall performed a snippet of “Thank You for Being a Friend,” the theme song to “The Golden Girls.” A laughing kookaburra and other squawking birds occasionally interrupted the speakers, which surely would have delighted the animal-loving White. “Animals were her kids and she loved them all — any shape, size and kind,” said Richard Lichtenstein, a board member of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association. White had worked with the zoo since its opening in 1966 untilher deathin December 2021, a couple weeks shy of her 100th birthday.  “Who didn’t love Betty White?” Lichtenstein said. “Her smile, her sense of humor, her basic decency. Our country, our city and yes, even our Los Angeles Zoo, would be much better if more people followed her example. Betty White put her stamp on everyone and anyone she came in contact with.” He said White’s financial support and advocacy helped make possible exhibits featuring chimps, gorillas and elephants, among others. Lichtenstein said White set up a private foundation before her death that funds various zoo programs. “This zoo, its inhabitants and this community meant so much to Betty White just as she meant so much to all of us,” said Amber McReynolds, chair of the USPS board of governors. “Betty White was an American treasure.” People lined up to purchase panes of 20 forever stamps, pins and notecards before getting first-day cancellations near a churro snack stand while schoolchildren walked by. “This stamp is special because let’s face it, everybody loves Betty White,” Stephanos said.

Judge says heat in Texas prisons unconstitutional as states face mounting lawsuits,https://apnews.com/article/hot-prisons-extreme-heat-lawsuits-unconstitutional-39537e84947def92867b1fc655e62b3f,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A federal judge has found the extreme heat in Texas prisons that don’t have air conditioning is “plainly unconstitutional.” But the judge declined Wednesday to order the state to immediately fix the problem, which could cost billions. Advocates for cooling Texas prisons construct a makeshift cell before a rally on the steps of the Texas Capitol, Tuesday, July 18, 2023, in Austin, Texas. The group is called for an emergency special session to address the deadly heat effecting inmates. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) An inmate works outdoors during the hot summer outside a Texas prison unit in Huntsville, Texas, on June 25, 2015. (Rose Baca/The Dallas Morning News via AP, File)      AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A federal judge’s rebuke of Texas housing prisoners in lockups without air conditioning stopped short of ordering a fix before summer in what has become of the country’s biggest lawsuits over keeping prisoners safe during dangerous extreme heat. But U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman’s warnings to Texas to act afterfinding the conditions in the prison system unconstitutionalcould resonate elsewhere in the U.S. where similar challenges are ongoing, according to attorneys leading the Texas case and other prisoner advocates. Texas is just one of several states, mostly in the South, facing lawsuits over prison conditions when temperatures often rise above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius). InLouisiana, a group of men incarcerated at a state penitentiary this week again asked a federal judge to take steps to protect prisoners doing outdoor agricultural labor in dangerous heat. “Texas is the largest prison system in the country and the judge found it to be acting in an unconstitutional manner and indifferent to dangerous conditions,” said Jeff Edwards, lead attorney in the Texas case. “Every warden and leader of a correctional system is going to be aware of it,” Edwards said. “It sends an incredibly powerful message.” The Texas case will not have authority over prisons in other states. But Corene Kendrick, deputy director of the ACLU National Prison Project, said the judge’s findings will be significant for lawsuits with the same issues of extreme heat, limited or no air conditioning, and inmates at risk of dying.  “It’s influential,” Kendrick said. Texas has more than 130,000 people in prisons. Only about a third of roughly 100 prison units are fully air-conditioned, and the rest have either partial or no electrical cooling. The lawsuit was initially filed in 2023 byBernie Tiede, the former mortician serving a life sentence whose murder case inspired the movie “Bernie.” Several prisoners’ rights groups then asked to join his legal fight and expand it. Several people who were formerly incarcerated in Texas testified that inmates would fake suicide attempts to be moved to cooler medical areas, while some would set fires so that guards would be forced to hose down cells. Texas officials acknowledged that heat may have been a factor in a handful of deaths in 2023 but dispute claims that the impact has been far greater. On Thursday, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said it has asked lawmakers for $118 million to install air conditioning for about 16,000 more beds. “TDCJ is dedicated to continuing to add air-conditioned beds in our facilities,” the agency said. In Louisiana, a federal judge last year ordered prison officials to increase shaded areas, schedule additional breaks, provide sunscreen and medical checks to those especially vulnerable to high temperatures. But the order did not shut down work on a former slave plantation when heat indexes reach 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31.1 degrees Celsius) or higher, which was what the plaintiffs had requested. The judge’s order has since expired and a group of inmates filed a new request for help. “As we enter the summer season in Louisiana, the State continues to force incarcerated people to work in the fields of a former plantation, under dangerous conditions, putting them at extreme risk of heat-related illness,” said Samantha Pourciau, Senior Staff Attorney at the Promise of Justice Initiative. The Louisiana Department of Correction did not immediately respond for comment. A federal lawsuit in New Mexico claims eight inmates were confined for hours in stifling summer heat in a prison transport van without working air conditioning. In Georgia, prison officials face a federal lawsuit from the family of a man who said he died after he was left in an outdoor cell without water, shade or ice in July 2023. The Texas case will proceed toward trial, where the judge warned the state of the likelihood it could be ordered to spend billions to install permanent air conditioning. The Texas Legislature is in session and currently writing the two-year state budget. Lawmakers have filed at least three bills that would provide some relief. Temperatures are rising as the Texas summer approaches. Some areas of the state have already hit above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius). “I’m regretful we can’t protect them with relief this summer,” Edwards said. “But we will move as fast as we can.” ___ Associated Press journalists Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Kate Brumback in Atlanta, Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed.

General Motors sank 7.4% for one of the market’s sharper losses after Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported cars. Ford Motor dropped 3.9%. EvenU.S. automakersselling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File)  “There are still a lot of unknowns, but if this remains in place, there will clearly be some pain for the companies to digest,” according to UBS analyst Joseph Spak. The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks are drifting in early trading. Among the uncertainties are how the U.S. government will determine how to apply tariffs to parts that are compliant with the free-trade agreement that the United States and Mexico and Canada have, but are not made entirely within the United States. Tracking parts could be difficult, according to Spak. Automakers based outside the United States also sank. In Seoul, Hyundai Motor dropped 4.3%. In Tokyo, Honda Motor fell 2.5%, and Toyota Motor lost 2%.  But U.S. electric-vehicle makers Rivian andTeslaheld up much better. They look to face less pressure from Trump’s tariffs because more of their production happens in the United States.

Among auto parts retailers, AutoZone gained 4%, and O’Reilly Automotive climbed 3.1%. CarMax, which sells used autos, rose 2.5%. Expectations are high for stock markets worldwide to remain shaky as an April 2 deadline approaches for tariffs. That’s what Trump has called “Liberation Day,” when he will roll out tariffs tailored to the United States’ trading partners. In each case, he said the “reciprocal” tariff will match the burden the other country places on the United States, including things like value-added taxes. Hopes are still high that Trump may ultimately opt for more targeted or milder tariffs that are less painful for the global economy than feared. But even if he does, all the talk about tariffs has already made U.S.consumersand businesses feel more cautious and pessimistic. If such sour moods convince them to pull back on their spending, it could hurt the economy. So far, the economy has seemed to be holding up. One report on Thursday said slightly fewer workers applied forunemployment benefitslast week than economists expected. It’s the latest sign the job market may be settling into a “low fire, low hire” state. A second report said the U.S. economy’s growth during the final three months of last year wasslightly strongerthan earlier estimated. The better-than-expected data helped Treasury yields in the bond market remain relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.36% from 4.35% late Wednesday. On Wall Street, Petco Health & Wellness jumped 31.6% after the retailer reported slightly stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. All told, the S&P 500 slipped 18.89 points to 5,693.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 155.09 to 42,299.70, and the Nasdaq composite fell 94.98 to 17,804.03. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe after finishing mixed in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.6% following the losses for many of its automakers, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday, “We strongly request that tariff measures not be applied to Japan.” In China, stocks rose 0.1% in Shanghai and 0.4% in Hong Kong. Chinese automakers and parts manufacturers have been expanding sales around the world, but not in the United States, so any impact from the tariffs announcement would be an indirect one.

(Dale Eicher via AP)     ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A federal investigation intomisuse of a student pilot’s licensecontinues for an Alaska man who waited hours for rescue with two young family members on the wing of plane after he landed on a partially frozen lake, where the aircraft partially sank. The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said like all pilots involved in accidents, the pilot in Sunday’s mishap, identified by an official and federal aviation records as John B. Morris Jr., of Kenai, is being investigated. In Morris’ case, he holds a student license which bars him from flying with passengers. The FAA has a range of disciplinary actions, up to suspending or revoking a student pilot’s license for violations. The plane, a Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser registered to Morris, landed for unknown reasons near the toe of a glacier on Tustumena Lake, on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula on Sunday. The pilot and passengers were rescued the following day after spending a cold night on the wing. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board also announced Thursday it was no longer investigating the incident.  Morris and two young family members, described by Alaska State Troopers as of elementary- and middle school-age, flew from the Soldotna airport on a sightseeing tour last Sunday. In a social media post, John Morris implored people to help search for his son and granddaughters, saying they were late returning from a Sunday afternoon flight. The plane didn’t have a locator beacon, and the last ping from the pilot’s cell phone put it in Tustumena Lake, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) south of Anchorage. Terry Godes, one of about a dozen good Samaritan pilots searching for the missing plane,spotted iton Tustumena Lake, and three people on the wing waved at him as he neared them Monday. Officials said the plane didn’t totally sink through the soft ice because cloth covering the wing helped keep it afloat. The Alaska Army National Guard dispatched a helicopter to rescue the three. They were flown to a nearby hospital with what officials described as non-life-threatening injuries. The girls were dry, but Morris Jr. got wet in the slowly sinking plane after getting them onto the wing. His phone also got wet and stopped working. The NTSB conducts accident investigations, and the FAA handles enforcement. Mark Ward, an NTSB investigator, earlier told The Associated Press that Morris Jr. did not report the incident within the required timeframe of 24 hours and did not return phone calls to them. Morris also hasn’t returned several messages this week to the AP. If the pilot landed on the lake that wasn’t as solidly frozen as he estimated, that’s a different scenario than if a mechanical issued forced them down, Ward said. The NTSB announced Thursday it was no longer investigating. “We were able to confirm that there was not substantial damage or serious injuries,” meaning it didn’t fall within the agency’s jurisdiction to investigate, spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said in an email. The FAA does look at “pilot qualifications and performance as part of every accident investigation,” said spokesperson Ian Gregor, also by email. He later said the agency does not ”comment on any aspect of an open investigation.” In 2018, Morris Jr. received his student pilot license with the limitation that he not carry passengers. Ward, the NTSB investigator, said he was told by the FAA that Morris appeared to have a history of violating the prohibition and had made no applications for a regular pilot’s license. Among other FAA prohibitions for a student pilot include not flying or carrying property for compensation or for hire, flying in furtherance of a business or flying internationally, except for solo training flights from the Alaska communities of Haines, Gustavus or Juneau to Whitehorse, Yukon, returning over the Canadian province of British Columbia. Student pilots flying passengers is among the more common violations of FAA rules, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Speaking generally, FAA sanctions depend on the circumstances of individual cases. Actions can include counseling and training on the low end to certificate suspensions or revocations on the high end.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)                   LONDON (AP) —King Charles IIIwas briefly hospitalized for observation on Thursday after experiencing “temporary side effects’’ related to a scheduledcancer treatment, Buckingham Palace said in a statement.  His engagements for Thursday afternoon and Friday were canceled.  “His majesty has now returned to Clarence House and as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow’s diary program will also be rescheduled,’’ the palace said. “His majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result.’’  The king’s health has been closely watched ever since early last year when he announced that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Charles, 76, stepped away from public duties for about three months butcontinued fulfilling state duties, such as reviewing government papers and meeting with the prime minister.  Charles’cancer diagnosishas heaped pressure on the British monarchy, which is still evolving after the 70-year reign of the late Queen Elizabeth II.

(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali, File)   When he succeeded his mother in September 2022, Charles’ task was to demonstrate that the 1,000-year-old institution remains relevant in a modern nation whose citizens come from all corners of the globe. But this task takes much time and energy.  Although the duties of a constitutional monarch are largely ceremonial, the royal whirl can be exhausting. Besides the occasional procession in full royal regalia, there are meetings with political leaders, dedication ceremonies and events honoring the accomplishments of British citizens. That added up to 161 days of royal engagements during Charles’s first year on the throne.   Charles’ illness came as his daughter-in-law, Kate, the Princess of Wales,was also diagnosed with cancer. Kate, the wife of Prince William, took more than six months off before returning to public duties in late September.

All Rights Reserved. Houses covered by snow are seen on the coast of a sea inlet at Nuuk, Greenland, Friday, March 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) LONDON (AP) — Greenlandic lawmakers on Thursday agreed to form a new government, banding together to resist U.S. President Donald Trump’sefforts to annex the Arctic island, local media reported. Four of the five parties elected to Greenland’s parliament earlier this month have agreed to form a coalition that will have 23 of 31 seats in the legislature. The agreement is set to be signed Friday, the newspaper Sermitsiaq reported, citing Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Demokraatit, the biggest party in parliament. The agreement comes as Trump ramps up his effort to gain control of Greenland “one way or the other.” U.S. Vice President J.D. Vanceis scheduled to arrive Friday in Greenland, where he will visit America’s Pituffik Space Base, which supports missile surveillance and missile defense operations. After his center-right party’s surprise victory in the March 11 election, Nielsen said he wanted to form the broadest coalition possible to help resist U.S. pressure. The final agreement excludes only one party, Naleraq, which left the coalition talks on Monday. Trump covets Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, because it has rich mineral deposits and straddles strategic air and sea routes at a time when the U.S., Russia and China are all vying for position in the Arctic. “The new coalition agreement could not have come at a more opportune time as it will signal to the Vances who arrive on the same day the unity forged in defiance of what has been perceived as a campaign of disrespect and intimidation,” said Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of the Polar Research & Policy Initiative.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)                          DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A new American airstrike campaign againstYemen’s Houthi rebelsappears more intense and more extensive, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel as well as dropping bombs in city neighborhoods, an Associated Press review of the operation shows.  The pattern underU.S. President Donald Trumpreflects a departure from the Biden administration, which limited its strikes as Arab allies tried to reach a separate peace with the group. It comes after the Iran-backed Houthis threatened toresume attacking “any Israeli vessel”and have repeatedly fired at Israel over the country’s refusal to allow aid into the Gaza Strip. President Donald Trump waves as he departs a reception celebrating Greek Independence Day in the East Room of the White House, Monday, March 24, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)   The Houthi attacks and the response to them have drawn new scrutiny in Washington after security officials in Trump’s administrationshared plans for the first round of strikeson the rebels in a group chat that included a journalist. But bombing alone may not be enough to stop the Houthis, whose earlier barrage of missile fire toward the U.S. Navy represented themost intense combatit had seen since World War II.  “Folks that say, ‘We’ll go in there and take out everyone with the last name Houthi and we’ll win.’ The Houthi leadership has been taken out in history in the past, and they are resilient,” retired U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Kevin Donegan said. “They came back and they grew stronger. So this isn’t something that is a one-and-done.” This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows B-2 stealth bombers, right side, parked at Camp Thunder Cove in Diego Garcia on Wednesday, March 26, 2025, as a U.S. airstrike campaign continues against Yemen’s Houthi rebels. (Planet Labs PBC via AP)   Meanwhile, concerns are growing over civilians being caught in the middle of the campaign. While the U.S. military has not acknowledged any civilian casualties since the strikes began over a week ago, activists fear strikes may have killed noncombatants already interritory tightly controlled by the Houthis.  “Just because you can’t see civilian harm doesn’t mean it’s not happening,” warned Emily Tripp, the director of the U.K.-based group Airwars, which studies Western airstrike campaigns.   Yemenis clean debris in front of their shops after a U.S. airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, Sunday, March 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Osamah Abdulrahman)       The Trumpcampaign beganMarch 15. American warships fired cruise missiles while fighter jets flying off of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier dropped bombs on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, a nation on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula that is the Arab world’s poorest.  “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World,” Trump said in a social media post announcing the campaign, days after his administration reimposeda “foreign terrorist organization” designationon the Houthis.  So far, the Houthis say the airstrikes have killed 57 people.  That’s just over half the 106 people the Houthis’ secretive leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, claimed the U.S. and U.K. killed during all of 2024. He provided no breakdown of combatants versus noncombatants. Houthi fighters often aren’t in uniform.

(AP Photo/Osamah Abdulrahman)   Al-Houthi said the two countries launched over 930 strikes last year. The U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, known as ACLED, has recorded 305 strikes. The discrepancy between the figures could not be immediately reconciled, though the Houthis could be counting individual pieces of ordnance launched, rather than a single event with multiple bombs used, as ACLED does. The rebels also have exaggerated details in the past. This image taken from video provided by the U.S. Navy shows an aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, Saturday, March 15, 2025. (U.S. Navy via AP)   Between March 15 to March 21, ACLED reported 56 events. The campaign also has seen the highest number of events in a week since the American bombing campaign began on Yemen during the Israel-Hamas war.  Trump administration officials have touted the differences between their strikes and those carried out under President Joe Biden.  “The difference is, these were not kind of pin prick, back and forth, what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told ABC’s “This Week” on March 16. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”  Waltz has also claimed key members of Houthi leadership, including their “head missileer,” have been killed. The Houthis have not acknowledged any losses in their leadership. White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz listens to a question from a reporter in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, Feb. 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)   There are indeed clear differences, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at ACLED. Under Biden, the focus appeared to be on mobile launchers for missiles and drones, then infrastructure, he said. Trump is targeting urban areas more intensely, judging from the number of strikes on cities so far.  “It’s very likely that somehow the Trump administration is pursuing a decapitation strategy,” Nevola added.  The Trump administration is also allowing the U.S. military’s Central Command, which oversees Mideast operations, to launch offensive strikes at will, rather than having the White House sign off on each attack as under Biden. That will mean more strikes.  Israel, which has repeatedly been targeted by Houthi missile fire and drones, including Thursday, also launched four rounds of airstrikes in 2024 and another in January.

(AP Photo)       During the Biden administration, Central Command offered details to the public on most strikes conducted during the campaign. Those details often included the target struck and the reason behind it.  Since the start of the new campaign, however, there’s been no similar breakdown.  Donegan, the retired vice admiral, praised that strategy during a recent call hosted by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. “You don’t tell the enemy what you’re going to do, and you don’t tell them what you’re not going to do.”  But that also means the Houthis’ description of targets is the only one that’s public. They’ve claimed two attacks targeted an under-construction cancer clinic in the city of Saada, as well as private homes and crowded city neighborhoods. There’s been no effort so far from the U.S. military to either dispute that or offer evidence to support strikes on those targets.  “It’s an extremely complicated information environment in Yemen,” Tripp, of Airwars, said. “The Houthis have extensive restrictions on (activists) and operations, media and press.”  Even so, some information can be gleaned from Houthi-released footage. One strike around Saada that the Houthis say killed a woman and four children included missile debris. Serial numbers on the fragments correspond to a contract for Tomahawk cruise missiles, an AP examination of the imagery showed. That corresponded to an assessment separately made by Airwars.  Including that Saada strike, Airwars believes it is likely that at least five U.S. strikes in the new Trump campaign that have hurt or killed civilians, based off of videos and photos from the site, Houthi statements and other details.  The U.S. military declined to answer questions regarding possible civilian casualties but said the “Houthis continue to communicate lies and disinformation.”  “CENTCOM won’t provide details on strikes and locations until the operation has concluded, and there is no additional risk to U.S. personnel or assets involved,” it added, using an acronym for Central Command. “At the direction of the president, CENTCOM continues to conduct strikes across multiple Iran-backed Houthi locations every day and night to restore freedom of navigation and restore American deterrence.”    From November 2023 — weeks after the Israel-Hamas war began — until January of this year, the Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones,sinking twoand killing four sailors.

(Etat-Major des Armées/France via AP, File)   The rebels said the campaign in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the two waterways was carried out in solidarity with Hamas. It stopped with theceasefire reached in that warin January.  The attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decadelong stalemated war.  Since the ceasefire ended, the Houthis have not resumed their attacks on shipping in the vital corridor for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Still, overall traffic remains sharply reduced.  A European Union naval force has been patrolling the Red Sea and escorting ships, as well as taking Houthi fire. However, the vast majority of Houthi attacks toward military targets has been pointed at U.S. Navy vessels. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, second from right, walks outside the Oval Office at the White House, Friday, March 21, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)       The U.S. airstrikes have kept up a daily tempo since beginning March 15. Meanwhile,the USS Carl Vinson and its carrier strike groupis to transit into the Middle East.  That, along with the Truman, will likely give the American military two places to launch aircraft since it hasn’t immediately appeared that any strikes came from bases in other Mideast nations — where public sentiment remains strongly with the Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war.  The U.S. military also may be bringing additional firepower, as radio transmissions from B-2 stealth bombers and flight-tracking data suggested the U.S. Air Force is moving a number of the aircraft to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.  Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP showed three B-2s parked Wednesday at Camp Thunder Cove on the island. That would provide a closer location for the long-range bombers to launch that’s still far outside of the range of the rebels — and avoids using allies’ Mideast bases.  In October, the Biden administrationused the B-2to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis.  But the future of Yemen itself remains in question. The Houthis broadly maintain control over the capital of Sanaa and the country’s northwest. Yemen’s exiled government is part of a fractious coalition that for now appears unable to wrest any control back from the rebels. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which launched a war 10 years ago against the Houthis,have pushed for peace talksas fighting appears broadly frozen on the ground.  “The United States can hurt the Houthis, it can weaken them,” wrote Gregory D. Johnsen, a Yemen expert at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, “but without effective ground troops — either its own or someone else’s — it will not be able to eliminate their capabilities.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Judge orders government to preserve Signal messages about Houthi military strike,https://apnews.com/article/signal-trump-houthis-strike-7d5a06d1c40a3c6af1c1ad1a772e87e0,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Signal app on a smartphone is seen on a mobile device screen Tuesday, March 25, 2025, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to preserve records of atext message chatin which senior national security officials discussed sensitive details of plans for a U.S. military strike against Yemen’s Houthis. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg barred administration officials from destroying messages that were sent over theencrypted messaging app Signalearlier this month. A nonprofit watchdog, American Oversight, requested the order. A government attorney said the administration already was taking steps to collect and save the messages. The Atlantic publishedthe entire Signal chat on Wednesday. Its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had been added to a discussion that included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, national security adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. On the chat, Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop before the attacks against Yemen’s Houthis began earlier this month. Hegseth laid out when a “strike window” would open, where a “target terrorist” was located and when weapons and aircraft would be used. The images of the text chainposted by The Atlanticshow that the messages were set to disappear in one week. American Oversight sued this week to ensure that the records are kept in accordance with the Federal Records Act. The group suspects that administration officials routinely use Signal to communicate.  “Defendants’ use of a non-classified commercial application even for such life-and-death matters as planning a military operation leads to the inevitable inference that Defendants must have used Signal to conduct other official government business,” American Oversight’s attorneys wrote in a court filing. Boasberg limited his order to messages sent between March 11 and March 15. “We are still ascertaining what records the agencies have,” Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said. “I’m glad we could figure out a solution,” the judge later said. He instructed the government to provide him with an update Monday. Boasberg said his order will expire April 10 “in the event that Defendants’ measures are satisfactory to the Court.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said no classified information was posted to the Signal chat. Hegseth’s spokesman, Sean Parnell, said in a statement Wednesday that “there were no classified materials or war plans shared. The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway.” Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffetold members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesdaythat Hegseth was responsible for determining whether the information was classified. American Oversight’s attorneys argued that the public is entitled to access government records even if they are auto-deleting messages that originated on officials’ private phones. “This is nothing less than a systematic effort to evade the rules for record retention in the federal government,” they wrote. “There is no legitimate reason for this behavior, which deprives the public and Congress of an ability to see the actions of government.” Boasberg, chief judge of the district court in Washington, has been at odds with the administration over a separate case involving flights deporting Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law. He temporarilyblocked the flightsand ordered at least two planes carrying immigrants to turn around, but that didn’t happen. The judge hasvowed to determinewhether the administration ignored his turnaround order. Boasberg, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, noted during Thursday’s hearing that his order shouldn’t harm the government since the agencies already were working to preserve the Signal messages.

Justice Department eyes combining ATF and DEA as part of broad restructuring,https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-restructuring-todd-blanche-a5c3251e186a88b1cd828a142bd41445,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

David Ake, File) The U.S. Department of Justice building is seen in Washington, Dec. 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)     WASHINGTON (AP) —Justice Departmentleadership is proposing combining the two agencies responsible for enforcing drug and gun laws as part of a dramatic restructuring of the department, according to a memo reviewed by The Associated Press. The memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche seeks feedback on a reorganization plan that would combine the Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives into a single agency “to achieve efficiencies in resources, case deconfliction, and regulatory efforts.” It’s part of a broader push by the Trump administration to shrink and reshape the federal government that has already led to a slew of legal challenges. PresidentDonald Trumphas directed agenciesto develop plansfor eliminating employee positions and consolidating programs. Perhaps the most sweeping part of the Justice Department’s plan is a push to merge the DEA and ATF, which often work together along with the FBI but are both led by separate directors and are tasked with distinctly different missions. The memo included no details about how the two agencies would be combined, or whether some of the agents would be eliminated. The ATF investigates things like violent crime, gun trafficking, arson and bombings. It also provides technical expertise tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations. The DEA, meanwhile, is in charge of enforcing the nation’s laws around drugs. Its agents are focused on combating criminal drug networks and stemming the illicit flow of fentanyl and other street drugs. Questions have been raised about the future of the ATF afterFBI Director Kash Patel — in an unusual arrangement — was tapped to simultaneouslyserve as acting leader of the gun law agency. The ATF has long drawn the ire of conservatives for its role in gun regulation.  Gun control group Giffords decried the proposal, saying “cutting resources from ATF would literally be defunding the police.” “The ATF’s mission is to stop violent gun crime and keep the public safe,” Giffords’ Executive Director Emma Brown said in a statement. “Cutting agents by merging the two agencies would reduce resources, weakening efforts to stop gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and gun dealers who are breaking the law.” The Justice Department plan also calls for combining policy offices in Washington and eliminating certain field offices around the country that work on things like antitrust and environmental matters. Tax division lawyers as well as employees in the section that handles public corruption cases would be reassigned to U.S. attorneys offices, except for a “core team of supervisory attorneys” that would remain in Washington, according to the proposal. The AP reported earlier this month thatlawyers in the public integrity section, which oversees public corruption cases, were told they will be asked to take new assignments in the department and as few as five lawyers may remain in the unit. A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately provide a comment on the plan, which is not been finalized. Heads of Justice Department agencies were instructed to respond with any concerns about the proposals by April 2.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

The first-time nominee’s nods include female artist of the year and female new artist. Notably, there are no nods forBeyoncé’s landmark “Cowboy Carter,”which won the Grammy for bothalbum of the yearand country album of the yearlast month.Miranda Lambert’s“Postcards from Texas”was also not nominated. The nominations for the 60th annual ACM Awards were announced Thursday. The awards ceremony will take place May 8 at the Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas, just north of Dallas. Reba McEntire will once again host. Six of Langley’s nominations stem from her smash hit “You Look Like You Love Me” with Riley Green. It’s up for single of the year, song of the year as both an artist and songwriter, music event of the year and visual media of the year as an artist and director. Cody Johnson, Lainey Wilson andMorgan Wallenclosely follow Langley’s nominations with seven each. Chris Stapleton has six nominations; Riley Green and Post Malone are tied with five. Johnson, Wilson, Wallen and Stapleton are up for the night’s top category, entertainer of the year. Kelsea Ballerini, Luke Combs and Jelly Roll are also nominated for the award. Wilsontook home the prize last year,becoming one of the few women to earn the trophy. Lambert was named entertainer of the year in 2022. In 2020, Carrie Underwood and Thomas Rhetttied for the title— a first ever. Underwood’s win was the first for a woman since 2012, when Taylor Swift won the category.  If Combs wins the category, he will have achieved the ACMs’ Triple Crown Award — which is made up of career wins in the entertainer of the year, new artist (male, female, duo or group) and artist (male, female, duo or group) categories.

(AP Photo/Javier Arciga)        ATLANTA (AP) — Black women around the world gather in salons, dorm rooms and living rooms for hours at a time to get synthetic braids put in their hair. But they’re wondering if the convenience and fashion benefits are being outweighed bypotential health hazards. The question circulating on social media and in the Black community follows on the heels of a proposed federal rule — that’s still in limbo after multiple delays — to ban thecarcinogen formaldehydein hair-straightening chemicals. There’s a thin body of research into the potential issues of using synthetic hair for braids. The latest addition is an independent study from Consumer Reports into chemicals found in braiding products. Some say the findings are concerning, but others are hesitant to make recommendations in part because the methodology did not go through a typical study review process. All of the experts who spoke with The Associated Press did agree more research is needed into synthetic braids and other products Black women often use in or on their hair. Here’s a look at what’s known, what’s not known and what you might want to do in the meantime. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on using synthetic hair for braiding.  Experts say it’s difficult to draw conclusions from prior studies. The Consumer Reports study, which was published in late February, said there were dangerous chemicals like lead, benzene and other carcinogens in 10 of the most popular synthetic braiding products. While experts said the presence of the chemicals is concerning and confusing, they noted the study didn’t go through the rigorous scrutiny that it takes to get published in a peer-reviewed science or medical journal. Javon Ford, a cosmetic chemist who talks about his work on social media, questioned the report’s findings, saying “the data set is so limited.” Consumer Reports only sampled two of each product, despite thousands on the market. James Rogers, the head of product safety at Consumer Reports who led the study, said his hope was to get the information out there because of the lack of research. He noted that it was a pilot project, but that “we thought the results were important enough to start the conversation.” Research published in 2020 in the journal Environmental Health Insights showed synthetic hair let off volatile organic compounds — chemicals that can easily evaporate into the air — when heated. Synthetic hair is sealed when braided, either by burning it or dipping it in hot water. That study detected many of the same chemicals named in the Consumer Reports study, like the known carcinogen benzene. Experts can’t answer whether the products are truly safe — but that’s because there’s so little research out there. There’s also little government oversight on the products, which leaves manufacturers to ensure that they’re safe. Consumer Reports is petitioning the Food and Drug Administration to begin regulating synthetic braiding hair. Jasmine McDonald, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who has studied the health impacts of chemical hair straighteners, said the Consumer Reports study shouldn’t invoke fear but awareness about the potential harms of braiding hair, the lack of federal regulations and the minimal research. “I think that in our culture, we sometimes normalize things to the point where we don’t see the harm ... the more that we can raise awareness that some of these cultural routines could potentially provide harm is us having the potential to stop that harm,” McDonald said. If you’re concerned about using synthetic braiding hair or straightening chemicals, there are other hairstyles to try. You can use Brazilian wool hair instead of synthetic hair, said Gloria Okpurukre, who owns Anointed Fingers braiding salon in Fayetteville, Georgia. You can also braid your real hair, but don’t expect the same results. “The purpose of adding the hair is for volume and length,” Okpurukre said. “A lot of people, their hair starts thinning out and they need to add something to make it look nice.” Some synthetic brands use banana fiber to create the hair, which companies say are less irritating to the scalp. But Ford said you won’t necessarily avoid chemicals just because you switch brands. Raven Baxter, a molecular biologist who has talked about braiding hair on social media, opted to stop using synthetic braiding products because of the lack of information — both on the packaging or in research studies. Now, she uses single-ingredient products in her hair care routine, like aloe vera gel and vegetable glycerin. “A lot of the work that scientists do, we’re able to do it because a funder deemed it as important to support that research,” she said, adding, “until we have funders that value the things that we’re concerned about, we’re not necessarily going to get the research published that concerns us.” McDonald suggested staying away from products that contain PFAS, parabens and other “forever chemicals.” She also said consumers can determine what’s in the products and their relative safety by looking at online databases, like the Breast Cancer Prevention Partners’ Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)       WASHINGTON (AP) — An appeals court in California has refused to halt a judge’s order requiring the Trump administration to rehire thousands of federal workers who were let go inmass firings. A split 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel turned back an emergency motion late Wednesday to pause the order from U.S. District Judge William Alsup in a case brought by labor unions and nonprofits as Republican President Donald Trump moves to dramaticallydownsize the federal workforce. Alsup is one of two judges who found legal problems with the way the firings of probationary workers were carried out. Two of the three judges on the panel ruled against the request for an emergency stay. The dissenting judge said the government had a strong argument against reinstating the workers. The government hasappealed Alsup’s order to the Supreme Court, arguing that judges cannot “micromanage” federal worker policies or force the rehiring of more than 16,000 workers. A response is due by April 3. Alsup ordered six departments to immediately offer job reinstatement to employees terminated on in mid-February: the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, the Interior and Treasury. The judge, who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said the firings were an attempt by the administration to sidestep laws and regulations governing a reduction in workforce by going after probationary workers, who have fewer protections.  Alsup said he was appalled that employees were told they were being fired for poor performance despite receiving glowing evaluations just months earlier. Probationary workers have been targeted for layoffs across the federal government because they are usually new to the job and lack full civil service protection. Lawsuits over the firings are among the many faced by the administration. More than three dozen rulings have at least temporarily slowedTrump’s second-term agenda. Within hours of Alsup’s ruling, a judge in Baltimore found separate legal problems with the handling of the firings. In a lawsuit brought by nearly two dozen states affected by the layoffs, U.S. District Judge James Bredar said the administration did not follow laws set out for large-scale layoffs. That case involved a wider range of agencies, and the plaintiffs estimate about 24,000 probationary workers are affected. The administration contends that states have no right to try to influence the federal government’s relationship with its own workers. Justice Department lawyers argued that the firings were for performance issues and are not the large-scale layoffs subject to specific regulations. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cast it as an attempt to encroach on the president’s power to hire and fire employees. There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers across federal agencies. They include entry-level employees but also workers who recently received a promotion. Leavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who facea lawsuitfrom The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Har reported from San Francisco.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The French leader said “several” nations other than France and Britain want to be part of the armed force but added, “It is not unanimous.” Paris and London say such a force would aim to secure any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking Ukraine again. “We do not need unanimity to achieve it,” Macron said. French and British military officials will work with Ukraine to determine where the contingents should be deployed and how many troops they’d need to be a credible deterrent, the French leader added. “There will be a reassurance force with several European nations that will deploy,” he insisted. The summit of leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs came at a crucial juncture in themore than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven bypressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. But fighting rages on. Before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace, Russian drone attacks overnight wounded more than 20 people and heavy shelling Thursday afternoon killed one person and knocked out electricity in parts of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said.  Macron and other summit participants accused Russia of only pretending to want a negotiated settlement. “They are playing games and they’re playing for time,” said U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “We can’t let them drag this out while they continue prosecuting their illegal invasion.” U.S.-brokered agreements this weekto safeguard shipping in the Black Seaand last week to haltlong-range strikes on energy infrastructurewere greeted as first steps toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead. One reason why some European countries are balking at a potential deployment in Ukraine is because it’s unclear whether Trump would support such a contingent with air power and other military assistance. “This will require the engagement and support of the United States,” Starmer said. “That’s a discussion we’ve had with the president on many occasions.” Macron suggested they may have to do without U.S. backing. “You have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” he said. “My hope is that the Americans will be on our side and that the Americans will support, even play an active role.” “But we have to be prepared for a situation where perhaps they won’t join in,” he added. Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent — U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops — would be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War butare now rearming. Starmer’s office said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details, examining “the full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.” Greece publicly rejected sending troops. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said those discussions were “somewhat divisive” and distracted from the goal of ending the war as soon as possible. Italy’sPrime Minister Giorgia Melonialso reiterated that Rome won’t contribute troops to a possible military force to be deployed to Ukraine. She also underlined the importance of working with the U.S. on ending the conflict and called for the participation of an American delegation in the next coordination meeting. In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on Europe to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, the proposed contingent is seen as a test of the continent’s willingness to defend itself and its interests. While the U.S. has spearheaded ceasefire talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted that Europe, represented by Macron and Starmer, must also be at the negotiating table. “We do not consider any alternative,” he said. “This is our firm stance. Europe is vast, and it must have clear representation in these negotiations.” Summit participants were more in agreement that sanctions squeezing Russia’s economy must be continued, and even toughened, to force Moscow to negotiate in good faith. “Lifting sanctions on Russia right now would be a disaster for diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said. “Sanctions are one of the few real tools the world has to pressure Russia into serious talks.” Russia has demanded that sanctions be lifted to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire. The White House said it would help restore Russia’s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, but it didn’t validate Moscow’s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Russia’s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump. Zelenskyy said: “They’re dragging out the talks and trying to get the U.S. stuck in endless, pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land.” As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine’s allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv’s hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression. Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support. Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. Separately, the Ukrainian Army General Staff said that its attack at Engels military airfield in Russia on March 20 had destroyed 96 air-to-air cruise missiles and significant reserves of aviation fuel. Satellite imagery taken the next day by Maxar Technologies appeared to show damage to ammunition and weapons storage at Engels, the main base for Russia’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers.

STORRS, Conn. (AP) — UConn coach Dan Hurley acknowledged there are things that “I wish I didn’t do” as he expressed regret over making profane comments about the officiating after the Huskies’NCAA Tournament lossto Florida. Hurley was caught on camera making those remarks as he walked off the floor and toward the locker room after UConn’s bid for athird straight national titleended with a 77-75 defeat in the tournament’s round of 32 on Sunday. “Those are three great officials on that game, so, although I said something in the heat of the moment, in an area of the arena that in pretty much every game I’ve ever coached in college has been media-free,” Hurley told theHartford Courantand other media outlets Wednesday. “Past the tunnel, by the locker rooms, in the hallway where the coaches go, that’s for the combatants, that’s for the competitors. That’s not for camera phones. Just relative to that, those were three great refs and Florida earned it. “If I don’t go off the rails at the end there, after that three-year run ended in excruciating fashion. … If I don’t have that emotional outburst there, probably all people are talking about is the run we’ve had, the amazing players.” Queen City News’Joey Ellisposted the video.Charlotte Sports Livereported that UConn sports information director Bobby Mullen asked Ellis to remove the video and then made a threatening comment to him.Ellis later saidon social media that Mullen apologized to him.  “Bobby regrets, just like I regret the moments I’ve had. Obviously it’s all my fault that Bobby got pulled into it,” Hurley told reporters. “I set the whole thing in motion and I feel horrible. Obviously he could’ve handled dealing with the media person with the phone that took the video (differently), he could’ve obviously let it go. He should’ve been better trained for a situation like this, we’ve been in them all year. “But Bobby’s a soldier. We all fight like that for each other in our program, and sometimes we go a little too far. But Bobby’s a great guy.” That capped a season in which Hurley had a number of other incidents, from having heated complaints with officials at the Maui Classic to taunting a fan after a victory at Creighton. “This is what UConn knew they were getting, this is how I’ve coached obviously my entire career – and I’m not bragging about that, I’m just surprised that people just discovered it if they’re college basketball experts,” he told reporters. “It’s one of those things where, they’re mistakes, there are things I wish I didn’t do, it’s part of what you get with me. I hope to not do it again. I’m going to attempt to take measures both internally, mentally, and externally. … I wouldn’t change one aspect of how I coach a game or how hard we fight.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Nearly every year there’s at least one lovable underdog that rises from obscurity in the NCAA Tournament to capture the hearts of basketball fans and bust their brackets. Not this year. All 16 regional semifinalists are from power conferencesfor the first time since the bracket expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The popular theory is that the transfer portal has led to a concentration of the best players at the big schools paying the most NIL money and, soon, the most through revenue sharing. Is this year just an anomaly? Purdue coach Matt Painter, whose 2023 team became the second No. 1 seed of all-time to lose to a No. 16 (Fairleigh Dickinson), sure hopes not. “The upsets and how valuable the upsets are to the common fan, it’s created March Madness,” he said Thursday. “Let’s not get away from it. It’s a big piece of March Madness.” Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd said it’s too early to know if the days of Cinderellas are over, or at least not as common. “I don’t know if there’s enough sample size yet to say this is NIL-driven or just how it broke this year,” Lloyd said. There were 15-seeds in the Sweet 16 three straight years recently —Oral Roberts in 2021,Saint Peter’s in 2022andPrinceton in 2023.Those Peacocks of Saint Peter’s made it all the way to the Elite Eight. And rememberFlorida Gulf Coast’s “Dunk City”team in 2013? It was the first No. 15 to win two games in a tournament. How about 2018 Loyola-Chicago,Sister Jean and the 11th-seeded Ramblers’ runto the Final Four?  Those types of storylines are conspicuously missing this year with the SEC sending a record seven teams to the Sweet 16, the Big Ten and Big 12 four apiece and the ACC one. That doesn’t mean the little guys haven’t provided some highlights. No. 12 seed McNeese State, with itssocial media star student manager, knocked off Clemson, while No. 11 Drake and itsfour Division II transfer starterstook out Missouri, andNo. 15 Robert Morrisplayed Alabama close until fading at the end. Kentucky’s Mark Pope said those games provided requisite March drama, and the depth of talent pool among players and coaches is so deep that there’ll always be jarring upsets. “I think it’s because it’s a pure meritocracy,” he said. “Once you start playing, doesn’t matter what your budget is, doesn’t matter if you came in on a bus or flew in on a plane. Doesn’t matter if you don’t have 17 different uniforms or if you have only one. Doesn’t matter if you have holes in your shoes or your 75th new pair.” BYU coach Kevin Young said this year’s Sweet 16 field illustrates the struggle mid-majors face in the new era of college athletics. “It’s not even that people are coming to get their players,” he said. “Kids are smart; they see what’s out there, and they think that they can better their situation by going in the portal and maybe going to a bigger school that can offer more to them.” Three of the five first-team AP All-Americans this season started out at programs outside the power conferences — Auburn’s Johni Broome at Morehead State, Alabama’s Mark Sears at Ohio and Florida’s Walter Clayton Jr. at Iona. Same with three of the second-team picks — JT Toppin of Texas Tech (New Mexico), RJ Luis Jr. of St. John’s (UMass) and John Tonje of Wisconsin (Colorado State). Nate Oats, who parlayedMarch magic at Buffalointo his current job at Alabama, said coaches at strong mid-major programs face a nearly impossible task keeping their rosters intact. “I don’t know that I would have been able to keep my whole team together at Buffalo in today’s day and age,” said Oats, whose 2018 and ’19 teams won first-round games. While power-conference programs are trending older with the transfer portal and not relying as much on high school recruits, Oats said, mid-majors that bring in the very best young talent will still have opportunities to win in March. “There’s a lot of freshmen that are not getting offered at the high-major level that would have used to get offered that now are ending up at mid-major schools, and some of them are really good,” Oats said. “Those mid-major schools, they’re going to have to do a really good job of evaluating talent coming out of high school. “I think it’s still going to be done, but it might be a little bit harder.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner)         ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A top European Union official visited a strategic metals site in centralGreeceon Thursday, after the bloc announced plans to accelerate production of its own critical minerals and reduce dependence on China. Stéphane Séjourné, an executive vice president at the European Commission, toured an aluminum plant that will soon extract gallium — a silvery, melt-in-your-hand metal used in advanced semiconductors, 5G antennas, solar panels and military radar systems. The Greek venture is one of dozens of projects announced by Séjourné this week, aimed at boosting the 27-nation bloc’s self-sufficiency in key minerals as demand for high-tech materials surges and geopolitical tensions rise. “This site is one of the 47 strategic projects selected to increase our production of critical raw materials and reduce our dependence on third countries,” Séjourné wrote in an online post after the tour in Greece. European officials say global supply-chain vulnerabilities have been exposed by theCOVID-19 pandemic, the war inUkraine, and more recently by trade disputes — includingexport controlsimposed by China last year on high-tech materials. Greece’s gallium project — the only one of its kind on the list — will tap into domestic bauxite sources and integrate extraction with the country’s existing aluminum infrastructure. Once operational, the plant, operated by Greece’s Metlen Energy & Metals company, is expected to produce up to 50 metric tons annually starting in 2027 — enough to meet most of Europe’s projected demand, according to EU and Greek officials.  “This is a significant investment of strategic importance — directly linked to the autonomy and security of both Greece and the entire European continent,” Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos said. EU funds will be part of a 22.5 billion euro ($24.2 billion) investment into mining and processing schemes for 17 minerals listed as critical across 13 EU member states. The minerals are vital ingredients in sophisticated products, including electric vehicles, battery parts, lightweight alloys for transport, and medical devices. At a presentation of the projects in Brussels earlier this week, Séjourné said he hoped to build public support for domestic mining. “I need to say this clearly: We do not want to replace our dependency on fossil fuels with a dependency on critical raw materials,” he said. “Chinese lithium must not become the Russian gas of tomorrow.” TheEU countrieshosting the strategic projects are Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and Sweden. The materials covered include aluminum, boron, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, graphite, lithium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, platinum group metals, rare earth elements, and tungsten. ___ Cook reported from Brussels.

SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — As top overall seed UCLA and star center Lauren Betts prepared for a Sweet 16 meeting with Mississippi, the Bruins’ thoughts were also on a familiar foe. UCLA won’t get a rematch against JuJu Watkins further down the line in theNCAA Tournamentbecause theSouthern California star suffered a season-ending knee injury in the second round. “I watched it live. It was just so hard to watch and I feel so sorry for her,” the 6-foot-7 Betts said. “And I feel so bad for that team and that program, to be honest. I know she’s such a crucial part of that program. I feel for her as a person and that’s not something that’s easy to come back from, but I know she’s going to be OK.” UCLA (32-2) plays fifth-seeded Ole Miss (22-10) on Friday night for a chance to advance to the Elite Eight, facing the winner of Friday’s earlier game between third-seeded LSU and No. 2 seed N.C. State. The Bruins earned the trip northwith a second-round 84-67 victoryover Richmond in Los Angeles. Betts had 30 points and 14 rebounds. Mississippi defeated Baylor in Waco, Texas,to reach the Sweet 16 for the second time in the past three years. In 2023, the Rebels upset Stanford in the second round before falling to Louisville. This time, the Rebels aren’t just happy to be here. “The difference is, I think, we’re hungry. I mean, to be honest, back then we were just happy to do something that hadn’t been done in a very long time,” guard Madison Scott said. “But now we’ve done it again. So we’re not complacent, we’re not satisfied. We want to keep going. We want to keep dancing.”  UCLA’s only two losses this season came against Watkins and the Trojans before the Bruins got their revenge in the Big Ten Tournament, beating USC 72-67. The Trojans will also play in Spokane, facing Kansas State on Saturday. It will be their first full game without Watkins, who tore the ACL in her right knee during the first quarter of a96-59 victory over Mississippi State. Watkins planted her right leg awkwardly as she drove to the basket between two defenders and crumpled to the floor, wincing and as she was carried off. USC later said she had season-ending surgery as the Trojans look to win their first national title in 41 years. Should USC get past the Wildcats, it will face either Paige Bueckers and UConn or Oklahoma in the Elite Eight. There’s still a chance for a rematch between the two Los Angeles rivals in the Final Four, but if it happens, it will be without Watkins. “To see, even a competitor, but someone who is a face of the sport, too, to just have her season end just like that? It sucks,” UCLA guard Kiki Rice said. “I mean, obviously we play against each other and it’s a rivalry, but you hate to see anyone go down with an injury like that. And she’s a great player, a great person.” LSU and N.C. State met earlier this season in a very different setting: the Bahamas. Then-No. 7 LSU won, 82-65. But anyone looking to that game as an indication of how Friday’s Sweet 16 meeting might play out would be mistaken, according to players on both sides. “I think we’re a much different team. I think at the beginning of the season, we were still trying to get a feel of each other,” Wolfpack senior guard Saniya Rivers said. “Obviously we have a lot of returners, but I feel like with the freshmen coming in, and obviously people playing out of position, we just weren’t very comfortable and confident. So as the season went along, we started putting pieces together.” N.C. State reached the Final Four last year before falling to eventual champion South Carolina. The Wolfpack (28-6) advanced this year with a second-round victory over Michigan State. The Tigers (30-5) routed Florida State 101-71 in the second round. LSU coach Kim Mulkey also said the Nov. 27 meeting with N.C. State was irrelevant. “To look at the previous, game, we just think that we’re both trying to advance to an Elite Eight and we don’t really even think about that game,” Mulkey said. “We talked about it once or twice, we’ve looked at some film, but they’re better. We’re better. They’re ACC champs. We finished third in the SEC. They’re supposed to win, they’re the two seed, we’re the three seed.” Mulkey’s players agreed that Friday’s opponent was a different team. While LSU (30-5) thrives on post play, N.C. State plays four guards at times and has a strong perimeter game. “I’m sure their their posts have developed and are better, but they have four outstanding guards and they’re not going to change their philosophy and all of a sudden become a post-dominant team,” Mulkey said. “So we know what their strengths are. We know what their improvements are. And we’re going to try to win one more game.” AP March Madness bracket:https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-womens-bracketand coverage:https://apnews.com/hub/march-madnessGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Things to know about the White House investigation into California’s law on students and gender,https://apnews.com/article/california-student-gender-law-trump-investigation-07fe08e17ca23c9228eb58705fba06ed,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Parents, students, and staff of Chino Valley Unified School District hold up signs in favor of protecting LGBTQ+ policies at Don Antonio Lugo High School, in Chino, Calif., June 15, 2023. (Anjali Sharif-Paul/The Orange County Register via AP, File) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Trump administration launched an investigation Thursday into the California Department of Education over a law that says districts can’t force teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school. The U.S. Department of Education said the policy may violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a law allowing parents to access their child’s records. “It is not only immoral but also potentially in contradiction with federal law for California schools to hide crucial information about a student’s wellbeing from parents and guardians,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office defended the law, saying parents still have the right to access their child’s education records. “If the U.S. Department of Education still had staff, this would be a quick investigation — all they would need to do is read the law the Governor signed,” Newsom spokesperson Elana Ross said in a statement, referencing Trump’splans to dismantle the agency. Now, the Education Department says it could take away funding if it determines California’s school gender-identity law violates federal rules.  It bans school districts from adopting or enforcing rules that require staff to disclose information about a student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to any other person without the child’s consent, unless otherwise required by law. That means if a student wants to use different pronouns, the school can’t force teachers to tell the students’ parents. It does not prohibit teachers and school staff from choosing to share that information with parents. Newsom signed the law last year, making California thefirst state to enact such a policy. It took effect Jan. 1. The law also requires the state education department to develop resources to support LGBTQ+ students and their families. A nationwide battle is underway over transgender rights, with some statesimposing bans on gender-affirming care,barring trans athletesfrom girls and women’s sports, and requiring schools to share students’ gender identity with parents without the students’ consent. Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli introduced a bill in 2023 that would have required schools to notify parents within three days of a school employee becoming aware of a child’s pronoun change. Lawmakers in the Democratic-dominated Legislature blocked the bill from receiving a hearing, so school boards started to take up the issue and pass so-called parental notification policies of their own. The statestarted a legal battlewith Chino Valley Unified School District, one of the first districts to enact such a rule, arguing the policy violated the rights of students and put the well-being of transgender children at risk. The district laterupdated its ruleto remove any mention of gender identification and require staff broadly to notify parents of any request their child makes for a change to their records. Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward, chair of the legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, introduced the bill largely in response to the school district policies. It passed on party lines. The goal is to protect the privacy of students, some of whom may live in unaccepting households and are not ready to tell their parents, backers say. Teachers should not be required to get involved in family discussions about a student’s gender identity, they argue. “Requiring governmental school officials to expose them without their consent runs afoul of the US Constitution,” Ward said in a statement, calling such policies “immorally invasive.” David Goldberg, president of the California Teachers Association, said the law helps ensure students have a safe and supportive learning environment. Critics of the law say parents should be able to know if their child changes their gender identification at school. Chino Valley Unifiedsued the stateover the policy, arguing it violated parents’ rights under the U.S. Constitution. “I would like to get very clear guidance to school districts that they absolutely should not have policies keeping secrets from parents,” said Jonathan Zachreson, a Roseville City School District board member. The Trump administration said children are at risk of falling victim to “radical transgender ideology” and medical interventions. Trumpset the toneon his administration’s stance on issues affecting transgender and nonbinary people during his first days back in office. He signed executive orders to restrict gender-affirming care for minors and transgender athletes’ participation in girls sports. Newsom has also been in the spotlight for his position on trans rights after hesaid on his podcastthat transgender athletes’ participation in girls sports was unfair. California has a state law, signed in 2013 by then-Gov. Jerry Brown, allowing students to participate on a sex-segregated sports team that aligns with their gender identity, regardless of the gender listed on the student’s records. A Republican bill seeks to reverse it; Newsom hasn’t taken a position. The Trump administration also sent a letter Thursday requesting the state to submit curricula and materials from a sexual health education program that receives federal funding. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will review whether the materials are “medically accurate” and “age-appropriate”, the letter said.

(AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard)             PARIS (AP) — Paris’ public prosecutor on Thursday requested thatFrench actor Gérard Depardieube found guilty and given a 18-month suspended prison sentence on the last day of a trial overaccusations that he sexually assaulted two womenwho were working on a film with him. The actor, 76, is accused of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of the movie “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”). He denied the accusations. “You’re going to declare Gérard Depardieu guilty of these sexual assaults,” the prosecutor told the court. He also requested a fine of 20,000 euros ($21,580). The prosecutor denounced Depardieu’s “total denial and failure to question himself.” The actor showed no apparent reaction. The maximum sentence for the charges is up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. The verdict, decided by a panel of judges, will be rendered on May 13. Depardieu’s long and storied career has turned the four-day trial into a post-#MeTootest of the willingness of France and its movie industry to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.  Earlier on Thursday, the plaintiffs’ lawyers called Depardieu a sexual predator and a “misogynist” in their final plea. The set dresser’s lawyer, Carine Durrieu Diebolt, said that he committed misconduct for decades towards “little people” in the cinema world. “Maybe you think he’s a great actor and you love his films,” she said. “Depardieu is also a sexual predator.” His status as a world-renowned actor made him both an artistic and an economic power in the film industry, in contrast with the plaintiffs, who risked being blacklisted if they spoke up, Durrieu Diebolt said, denouncing what she called a “system of impunity.” “Depardieu, when he’s touching women’s bodies, he’s exercising his power over them,” she said. On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser. He said hegrabbed her hipsduring an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual. The lawyer for the other plaintiff started her plea with a minutes-long list of obscene words and other vulgar expressions rarely heard in a courtroom, saying: “That’s how Gerard Depardieu behaves on a film set, that the atmosphere he’s imposing around him.” “No, you can’t separate the man from the artist,” said the lawyer, Claude Vincent. “He is Gérard Depardieu, a misogynist amid misogynists.” The plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set. The Associated Press doesn’t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither women has done so in this case. Vincent noted that Depardieu defended director Roman Polanski, accused in the still-unresolved Los Angelescriminal sexual assault casethat prompted him to flee to Europe in 1978. Speaking Wednesday about his career and life, Depardieu mentioned Polanski as being “persecuted” for 50 years. “Some would say I’m from the old world. Certainly,” he said. Three other women — a journalist, a former costume designer and a comedian — also testified Wednesday in court that they were sexually assaulted by Depardieu in 2007, 2014 and 2015. Those cases are covered by the status of limitations. Depardieu has rejected the accusations since the beginning of the trial Monday, saying he’s “not like that.” He is being tried by a panel of three judges, not a jury, which is normal for such cases. The judges don’t issue their verdict right away, but generally deliberate for weeks or months. Depardieu may have to face other legal proceedings soon. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024 prosecutors requested that it go to trial.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved. Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is seen on a screen in the courtroom of the International Criminal Court, in The Hague, Netherlands, March 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File) MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte marked his 80th birthday in detention in the Netherlands Friday after theInternational Criminal Courtordered his arrest, while in the Philippines, police forces braced for planned protests by his followers and opponents. Duterte’schaotic March 11 arrestat Manila’s international airport by police forces, which the ICC sought on an alleged crime against humanity, was a sobering turning point in the life of one of the most unorthodox leaders of the Philippines. While president, he publicly cursed thenPresident Barack Obama and the pope, calledGod stupidand warned that he would be“happy to slaughter”3 million drug addicts in his country, the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia, comparing his anti-drugs crackdown with Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust. The ailing Duterte, now locked up in a detention center in The Hague seaside suburb of Scheveningen, about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) from the global court’s headquarters, was “in high spirits” and would be visited on his birthday by his Filipino common-law wife and their daughter, according to Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, the ex-president’s daughter, who has been visiting him in detention. A bag of clothes from his southern Philippine home and his favorite sugar-free soft drinks have been delivered to him in detention and a request for dental floss would follow, she told journalists and supporters earlier this week in The Hague. She added that she urged her father to cook his own food, an advice he said he could not likely follow, and write a book while in detention. “I’m too old to write a book,” she cited her father as saying.  On March 15, the former president appeared for the first time by video from his detentionbefore judges at the ICCafter his arrest in Manila for alleged crimes against humanity. The case stemmed from thedeadly anti-drugs crackdownshe oversaw from November 2011 until March 2019 while serving as mayor of Davao city and later as president. ICC prosecutors accused Duterte of serving as an “indirect co-perpetrator” in the widespread murders, an allegation he has generally denied although he acknowledged under oath in a Philippine Senate inquiry last year that he had maintained a“death squad” of gangstersto kill other criminals when he was mayor. He denied authorizing police to gun down thousands of suspects when he was president but has repeatedly threatened drug traffickers with death and publicly told law enforcers to open fire on suspects, who violently resist arrests. The estimated death toll in the police-enforced campaign during Duterte’s presidential term alone ranged from the more than 6,250 that Philippine authorities had reported to about 20,000 and 30,000 based on some human rights groups’s estimate. In the ICC, Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc set a pretrial hearing on Sept. 23 to establish if prosecution evidence is strong enough to send Duterte to trial, which could take years. If Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Duterte could also apply for a temporary release, a prospect that has been opposed by still-fearful families of mostly poor suspects killed in his crackdowns. A former government prosecutor, Duterte carved a political name decades ago with his violent approach to criminality and profanity-laced outbursts. He remained a deeply polarizing figure even after his detention in Europe. Philippine police forces went on alert to guard planned protests on his birthday. His supporters were expected to call for his release in prayer rallies in Manila and in his southern home region. Left-wing activists said they would separately parade a mock coffin with portraits of victims of Duterte’s crackdowns to call for justice and accountability. Duterte’s family has questioned the legality of his arrest and surrender to the global court by the police under Pres. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., saying he should have been allowed to challenge the actions in a Philippine court. The Dutertes and Marcos have becomebitter political opponents. Last week, Sara Duterte called out the Philippine military for standing “idly by while a former commander-in-chief was taken from a military base under questionable circumstances.” The Armed Forces of the Philippines issued a statement Thursday to underscore its political neutrality. “Any deviation from this principle would undermine the very democracy we are bound to protect,” the military said.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File)     NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The backup guard for Notre Dame put his hands on his head as he soaked in the scene of students and fans who stormed the court in jubilation after the Irish knocked off No. 1 Syracuse. For most players — especially one without a path to pro ball like thatIrish big man,Alex Dragicevich -- beating a top-ranked team would be the watershed moment of his career. It was, for sure, and Dragicevich enjoys reliving that moment, only not as some old-timer who continuously basked in the good old days of that 2012 upset, but as the set-up for a joke in his set as he tours the road making a living as a comedian. At 6-foot-6, Dragicevich stood tall over a four-year collegiate career split between Notre Dame and Boston College. He’s now one of the biggest — in size, at least — stand-ups in comedy. His basketball career is easy source material for his gigs at spots like Goofs Comedy Club or the House of Comedy. “I got to play in March Madness a couple of times,” he says, “so clearly I’ve peaked. Even if I have a kid one day, and my wife’s like, ‘Hey, isn’t this the best moment of our lives?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, it’s up there.’ I beat Syracuse when they were No. 1 in the country. That baby is not even ranked. It’s not even a Top 25 baby. It’s not even a 12-seed baby.” Dragicevich had a solid playing career, averaging 6.6 points as a sophomore for Notre Dame, but it was the “class clown vibes” he gave off at home and inside the locker room that made a life in comedy seem more feasible than chasing a professional career overseas. Dragicevich joined the “Hello, Shovelhead!” sketch comedy group during his years at Boston College and -- with the blessing of his coach, Steve Donahue — seriously started the pursuit of comedy.  “I don’t think comedy seemed like a reasonable thing to do until I got to Boston,” Dragicevich said. Dragicevich, who’s single, lives in Brooklyn and still keeps an unspecified day job. He met and became friends with future touring comedians and working actors (such as internet personality Brett Dodenhoff) who told him he had the comic chops needed to break into an often relentless, ruthless profession. Think going scoreless on a road game is rough? Try bombing a road comedy gig. His dry, observational humor takes aim at topics from aging, his height, hisSerbian roots, his family and relationships. Oh yes, and more basketball. Such as, Dragicevich pokes fun at college athletes who always shower God in glory. “When the cheerleaders were throwing a party, none of my friends were like, hmm, I’m going to pray on it,” Dragicevich says in one Instagram clip. Dragicevich’s college career ended in 2015, and he’s pretty much been a touring comedian over the last decade -- nothing but laughs! -- and also, like many of his peers, hosts a podcast. He’s happy with his set and is ready to film his first hour for a stand-up special. His career arc from layups to laughs is a bit out of the lane for former college basketball players. Mahershala Ali played at St. Mary’s before he became an Oscar nominee. Bill Bradley went from Princeton to politics. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has spent decades as an actor. Dragicevich is one of the few to try his hand at punch lines and is still trying to figure out which is harder, becoming a successful D-I athlete or a successful comic. “Were either a success? Who’s to know,” Dragicevich quipped. While Dragicevich cracked, “I played enough to realize I wasn’t very good,” he’s still chasing the shining moment on stage he found all those years ago beating Syracuse. “When you have a great set, those are tough to top,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve had anything like beating Syracuse yet. But I’ve had some really great nights on stage. They’re both pretty damn amazing.” AP March Madness bracket:https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracketand coverage:https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart)       NEW YORK (AP) — The co-founders of a company that makes lip products for darker skin tones no longer hope to get their lineinto Target. A brother and sister who make jigsaw puzzles celebrating Black subjects wonder if they need to offer “neutral” images like landscapes to keep growing. Pound Cake and Puzzles of Color are among the small businesses whose owners are rethinking their plans as major U.S. companies weaken their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The initiatives mostly date from the endPresident Donald Trump’s first termand entered a new era with the dawn of his second one. Some Black-owned brands suspect big retail chains will droppartnerships they pursuedafter the police killing of a Black man in 2020 reignited mass protests against racial injustice. In today’s anti-DEI climate, other entrepreneurs worry about personal repercussions or feel pressure to cancel contracts withretreating retailers. “It becomes a question of, are the big box stores going to be there? Do we even make any attempt to talk to these people?” Ericka Chambers, one of the siblings behind Puzzles of Color, said. “We are really having to evaluate our strategy in how we expand and how we want to get in front of new customers.”  Chambers and her brother, William Jones, started turning the work of artists of color into frameable puzzles the same year a video captured a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling onGeorge Floyd’sneck. Amidthe Black Lives Matter protestsover Floyd’s death, a fashion designer challenged large retailers to devote 15% of their shelf space and purchasing power to Black businesses. The Fifteen Percent Pledge helped bring Puzzles of Color’s creations to Macy’s and Nordstrom’s websites in 2022. Last year, they made it into select Barnes & Noble stores. Chambers said she’s confident in the companies’ commitments but recalled a backlash after news outlets covered the brand, which is based in Texas. “It does make us think about how we envision ourselves as far as the safety of not wanting to be attacked, because some people are very vocal about being anti-DEI,” Chambers said. Vibrant depictions of Black women account for many of her and Jones’ puzzles. The pair figured they needed to provide more abstract designs for certain Barnes & Noble locations to give Puzzles of Color “a little bit of a fighting chance.” The first prominent names in U.S. retail to end or retooltheir diversity programssurfaced last summer amid threats of legal challenges and negative publicity from DEI critics, who argue that setting hiring, promotion and supplier diversity goals for underrepresented groups constitutes reverse discrimination. After Trump won a second term in November,Walmart joined the corporate pullback. Target’s suspension of its comparable DEI targets in January stung Black and LGBTQ+ customers harder, largely because they regarded the Minneapolis-based company asmore of a natural ally. The company said it would continue working with a diverse range of businesses. Philadelphia-based Pound Cake’s co-founders, Camille Bell and Johnny Velazquez, said they don’t think they would agree at this point if the retailer offered to stock their lipsticks and lip oils. “Target would have been a great boost to our business’s growth,” Velazquez said. “We’ll just find it elsewhere.” Target’s stance has created a dilemma for brand founders with existing distribution deals. One is Play Pits, a natural deodorant for children that Maryland resident Chantel Powell launched in 2021. The product is found in about 360 Target stores. The retailer’s DEI program “allowed us to employ amazing people, give back to our community, and exhibit Black excellence on and off the shelves,” Powell wrote on LinkedIn as civil rights leaders talked about boycotting Target. She and some other product creators highlighted the impact boycotts might have on their businesses. They urged upset customers to intentionally limit their purchases toitems from Black-owned enterprises. Some activists understood; others pushed the brands to join the protest by cutting ties with Target. “The conversation around Black brands, that they should pull out of the retailers that they’re in, is unrealistic,” Powell said this month asa 40-day, church-organizedTarget boycott was underway. “We signed up to be in business. I understand why people are having that conversation of boycotts. As a Black founder, I also understand the side of how it can be detrimental.” The owner of a Black-owned sexual wellness business with its own line of condoms has a slightly different take. Target started carrying B Condoms in 2020, and founder Jason Panda said the company told him late last year that it didn’t intend to keep the prophylactics in the 304 stores that stocked them. Panda says he isn’t worried. The product is available through Amazon and in more than 7,000 CVS stores, he said. What’s more, contracts with non-profit organizations and local governments that distribute condoms for free are the cornerstone of the business he established in 2011, Panda said. “My money has never really come from mainstream,” he said. “We’re going to be protected as long as I can maintain my relationship with my community.” Brianna Arps, who founded the fragrance brand Moodeaux in 2021, notices fewer grants available to Black brand creators these days. She used to apply for 10 to 15 every week or two; the number is down to five to seven, Arps said. “A lot of the organizations that had been really vocal about supporting (Black businesses) have either quietly or outwardly pulled back,” she said. Moodeaux was the first Black-owned perfume brand to get its perfumes into Urban Outfitters and Credo Beauty, which specializes in natural vegan products. Inthe current environment, Arps is looking to expand her brand’s presence independent shops and to support other Black fragrance lovers. “The resiliency of brands like ours and founders like myself will still exist,” she said. Aurora James, the founder of the Fifteen Percent Pledge, said nearly 30 major companies that joined the initiative remain committed to it, including Bloomingdale’s, beauty retailer Sephora, J. Crew and Gap. Ulta Beauty, another pledge signatory, and Credo Beauty carry Pound Cake products. Velazquez and Belle want to use social media to direct their followers to support retailers like Ulta and to bolster their online sales. “It’s going to be fostering the community that we have and growing that,” Velazquez said. While making a strategic decision “to appeal to a broader audience” when selecting puzzles for Barnes & Noble, Chambers said she plans to introduce Black faces and experiences to the chain’s bookstores over time, in boxes of 500, 750 and 1,000 pieces. In the meantime, Puzzles of Color expanded its “Pride” collection as a response to the DEI backlash. The subjects include Harriet Tubman, a mother and daughter tending a garden, and a little girl in a beauty supply store gazing up at hair accessories. “Do we lean in all the way?” Chambers asks herself. “Part of why we started this was because we didn’t see enough Black people in puzzles.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Finding health advice on social media is easier than knowing which claims to trust,https://apnews.com/article/wellness-advice-social-media-influencers-supplements-cf040ff9a3f2f3d8e759a8333747fa91,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File)       In the corners of social media dominated by wellness content, influencers recommend an assortment of treatments and products to support weight loss, fight exhaustion or promote other desired health outcomes. Some of the endorsed approaches may be helpful. Many play into fads with scant evidence to back up enthusiasts’ claims, medical experts say. Some influencers encourage their followers to avoid specific food items, such asseed oils, while others advocate going all in on certain foods, such as the meat-heavy carnivore diet. There are video pitches for berberine, a chemical compound that’s been touted online as “nature’s Ozempic,” and for non-medical IV vitamin therapy, which businesses popularly known as drip bars market as cures for hangovers or fatigue. To be sure, alternative health practices and cures that lacked the medical establishment’s backing were a part of popular culture long before the internet age. But the plethora of advice shared online has both prompted calls for safeguards and found a measure ofmainstream acceptance. The new U.S. health secretary,Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had hisInstagram account suspendedin 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr.Mehmet Ozaccused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia’s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app. With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online: Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don’t necessarily mean content creators don’t believe in what they’re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work. Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it’s therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the “buy” button, whether it’s for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed. Researchpublished last monthin the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with “some form of financial interest” in promoting the screenings. After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to “mention important harms, including overdiagnosis” resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels. Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as “the backbone” of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue. “It’s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it’s a red flag,” he said. “I don’t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.” In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers. “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is,” Bryant said. Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it’s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices. In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database. The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct. If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations. Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency’s interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed. In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted “sugar-containing products” and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians. If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it’s best to check and see if what they’re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus. “Just because somebody has an ‘M.D.’ after their name doesn’t make them entirely trustworthy,” said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology. Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they’ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review. In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader, File)     WASHINGTON (AP) — Installation of renewable energy worldwide hit a record high last year, with 92.5% of all new electricity brought online coming from the sun, wind or other clean sources, an international agency reports. Nearly 64% of the new renewable electricity capacity in 2024 was in China, according to Wednesday’s report bythe International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).Overall, the world added 585 billion watts of new renewable electrical energy, a 15.1% jump from 2023, with 46% of the world’s electricity coming from solar, wind and other green non-nuclear energy sources. But even that big jump does not put the globe on track to reach the international goal of tripling renewable energy from 2023 to 2030, with the world on pace to be 28% short, IRENA calculated. The goal wasadopted in 2023as part of the world’s efforts to curb theincreasing impacts of climate changeand transition away from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. “Renewable energy is powering down the fossil fuel age. Record-breaking growth is creating jobs, lowering energy bills and cleaning our air,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “But the shift to clean energy must be faster and fairer.” China added almost 374 billion watts of renewable power — three quarters of it from solar panels — in 2024. That’s more than eight times as much as the United States did and five times what Europe added last year.  China now has nearly 887 billion watts of solar panel power, compared to 176 billion in the United States, nearly 90 billion watts in Germany, 21 billion watts in France and more than 17 billion watts in the United Kingdom. A floating solar farm operates on the Cottbuser Ostsee lake near Cottbus, Germany, Oct. 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader, File)  United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell used the figures Wednesday to challenge Europe and other industrialized nations to catch up with China. “As one government steps back from climate leadership, it opens up space for others to step forward and seize the vast benefits,” Stiell told European leaders in Berlin, making reference to U.S. President Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. “The clean energy transition can be Europe’s economic engine-room now — when new sources of growth are vital to buttress living standards and for decades to come.” Stiell said the IRENA numbers show that the “global renewables boom is unstoppable” and said the market for green energy reached $2 trillion last year. The move to renewables can grow even faster, said Neil Grant, senior policy analyst at Climate Analytics, which tracks and projects countries’ climate change fighting efforts. “If in 2024 renewables grew 15%, think how much faster they could grow with the full backing of comprehensive, credible and ambitious climate policies around the world,” said Grant, who wasn’t part of the IRENA report.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                               LOS ANGELES (AP) — When filmmaker Travis Gutiérrez Senger reflects on ASCO’s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence onChicano art history. “That movement continues today, and it’s very expansive,” he says. “There’s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.” He’s referring to “ASCO: Without Permission,” a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herrón III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group “asco” — “nausea” or “disgust” in Spanish — after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles. All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way. “To behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,” said executive producer Gael García Bernal at the film’sSouth by Southwest film festivalpremiere earlier this month. “You’re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.”  Bernal and Diego Lunaexecutive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution. Patssi Valdez, a founding member of the Chicano art collective ASCO (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Gutiérrez Senger’s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO’s early rebellion. “I felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,” said Gamboa. Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding. “For the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn’t happened before,” she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators. ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid theEast LA walkouts, protesting education inequality,and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality. Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities. “The response to such violence was to create art,” said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints. For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet. “I couldn’t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,” said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled “Instant Mural,” a metaphor on feeling captive. One of ASCO’s most known works is “Spray Paint LACMA.” Gamboa, Gronk and Herrón spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, “Chicanos are in gangs, they don’t make art.” Harry Gamboa Jr., a founding member of the Chicano art collective ASCO (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  “There was another era when people said, ‘Latinx art, you know, doesn’t exist. It’s not a thing. It doesn’t belong. It’s not part of American art,’” said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of theLucas Museum of Narrative Art. ASCO’s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In “Station of the Cross,” the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War. In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media’s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story. ASCO’s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted “ASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,” the first retrospective to present the group’s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment. “Latino history has always been erased,” said Gutiérrez Senger. “‘ASCO: Without Permission’ is a story of winning a battle, not a war.” A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards — a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on thelack of Latino representation in Hollywood. The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member. “Hollywood movies, rock ’n’ roll. That’s what I was about,” said Valdez. “And that’s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.” Gamboa photographed Herrón, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called “No Movies” and later inspired their satirical award show. Gutiérrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists — including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha — in short films inspired by ASCO’s signature DIY style. “I think it’s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you’re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,” said Gutiérrez Senger. “We have rich stories, and we have a rich history.” Travis Gutiérrez Senger’s latest documentary, “ASCO: Without Permission” chronicles the story of a 1970s Chicano art group named “asco.” Their name translates to “nausea” or “disgust” in Spanish. ASCO used their conceptual work and performance art to speak of issues related to the Chicano civil rights movement. (March 27) “ASCO: Without Permission” includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, includingactor Michael Peñaandcomedian Arturo Castro,who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history. “Our history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we’ve had are not in the history books,” Peña says in the documentary. Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and “misbehave and not ask for permission.” “You do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,” said Gamboa. “And the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Napoleon Dynamite served tater tots on a plate instead of stuffing them in his pocket — and threw his Sweet 16 vote behind BYU. Actor Jon Heder — who starred as the tots-obsessed title character in the cult comedy classic “Napoleon Dynamite” — appeared with a tray of tots before BYU was set to play Alabama in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night. Heder was set to meet with BYU’s Richie Saunders, adescendant of the manwho invented tater tots and made them the hottest snack during March Madness. “I’m here to support BYU, to support tots around the world,” Heder said. Saunders and his tots roots — his great-grandfather, F. “Nephi” Griggs, is the founder of Ore-Ida — has become one of the surprise stories during a tournament largely devoid of bracket-busting upsets. Saunders has cashed in with an endorsement deal that stuck him in advertisements, and Ore-Ida dishes out the crispy sides for free when BYU wins in March Madness. Ore-Ida ceremonially changed its name to Ore-Richie for the length of BYU’s run in the tournament in tribute to Saunders, and the company was giving away free tots nationwide from tipoff to the final buzzer of BYU’s Sweet 16 game. If the Cougars win their first national championship — they are 80-1 long shots, per BetMGM Sportsbook — Ore-Ida will release a new limited-edition offering:“Richie’s Tater Shots,”inspired by Saunders’ jumper. Saunders became the most popular potato pitchman sinceNapoleon Dynamite.  In “Napoleon Dynamite,” Heder’s curly-haired, socially awkward character ultimately triumphs over the high school jocks and cheerleaders because of his quirks, rather than in spite of them. The movie spawned the “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt and made Napoleon’s disgusted version of “Gosh!” into a catchphrase. It also celebrates the unabashed love of tater tots by Napoleon, who stuffs the deep-fried nuggets into his pockets and eats them while in school. “Napoleon, give me some of your tots,” one of his classmates barks. Heder went on to star with Will Ferrell in “Blades of Glory” in 2007, among other movies. But no role has defined the 47-year-old actor — who wore an Ore-Ida T-shirt at the Prudential Center — quite like Napoleon Dynamite. “I have a connection to tots that harkens back to 20 years ago,” he said. “Before that time, I also went to BYU. We’re at a crossroads right now where my childhood meets my education meets my professional life. It kind of makes sense for me to return to the middle of the crossroads, to meet the devil again and make some new deals.” That deal included a hopeful BYU victory. “If they win,” Heder said, “I know it’s because of me.” AP March Madness bracket:https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracketand coverage:https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness.

(AP Photo/Michael Casey)                 BOSTON (AP) — A Turkish studentdetained by federal officersas she walked along a street in a Boston suburb is the latest supporter of Palestinian causes to be swept up in the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants who express their political views.  Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, a doctoral student at Tufts University, was swiftly moved out of Massachusetts, another case of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sending immigrants taken into custody to detention centers ordeporting them altogetherbefore a federal judge has a chance to weigh in and possibly halt the actions. This contributed photo shows Rumeysa Ozturk on an apple-picking trip in 2021. (AP Photo)   Ozturk, who was detained Tuesday shortly after she left her home in Somerville, had been moved to an ICE detention center in Louisiana by the time her lawyer went to court and a judge ordered her to be kept in Massachusetts, U.S. government lawyers said in a court document Thursday. They said they made her lawyers aware that she was being moved and facilitated contact with her Wednesday night.  A seniorDepartment of Homeland Securityspokesperson said federal authorities detained Ozturk after an investigation found she had “engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.” The department did not provide evidence of that support. AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports a student from Turkey is caught up in the Trump administration immigration crackdown.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration has revoked the visas of at least 300 people, including Ozturk: “We do it every day.”     “We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist, to tear up our university campuses,” Rubio told reporters during a stop in Guyana.  Friends and colleagues of Ozturk said she was not closely involved in pro-Palestinian protests that broke out oncampuses last spring. Her only known activism, they said, was co-authoring an op-ed in a student newspaper that called on Tufts University to engage with student demands to cut ties with Israel.  “The only thing I know of that Rumeysa organized was a Thanksgiving potluck,” said Jennifer Hoyden, a friend who studied with Ozturk at Columbia University’s Teachers College. “There’s a very important distinction between writing a letter supporting the student Senate and taking the kind of action they’re accusing her of, which I’ve seen no evidence of.”  Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in an attack that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and during which about 250 hostages were seized.Israel’s retaliatory offensivehas killed more than 50,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.  Ozturk’s arrest appears to be part of President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport students he said engage in “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity,” a label the administration has applied broadly to those who criticize Israel and protest its military campaign in Gaza.   Earlier this month, immigration enforcement agentsarrested and detainedMahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident and Palestinian activist who played a prominent part inprotestsat Columbia last year. He is now facing possible deportation.

(AP Photo)   Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney specialist from Lebanon who was due to start as an assistant professor at Brown University, was deported earlier this month — after a federal judge ordered that she not be removed until a hearing could be held. Homeland Security officials said Alawieh was deported despite having a U.S. visa because she “openly admitted” supporting aHezbollah leader.  A University of Alabama student has also been detained by ICE, the university confirmed. The Crimson White, the student newspaper, reported that Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student from Iran studying mechanical engineering, had been detained. But neither the university nor the newspaper explained why Doroudi had been taken into ICE custody.  On Thursday evening, a few hundred people turned out at Somerville City Hall to rally for Ozturk’s release and for the greater Palestinian cause.  Speakers railed against Israel over the war in Gaza as well as the ICE raids that protesters said have left immigrant communities terrified. They also sang songs supporting the Palestinians — sometimes accompanied by a horn section — and led the crowd in chants of “Resistance Is justified when people are occupied.”  Among the speakers was Lebanese American Carina Kurban who said she was furious when she heard about the arrest of Ozturk and other scholars.  “I was born here. I’m a U.S. citizen, and I need to use that privilege that I have to speak up for those who can’t because of everything that’s happening with this administration,” Kurban said.  “America was built on free speech, so if we don’t have that, then what?” she added. “Then where do we go?”    Video obtained by The Associated Press appeared to show six people, all but one with their faces covered, taking away a shouting Ozturk’s phone before she was handcuffed on Tuesday.  “We’re the police,” members of the group are heard saying in the video.  A bystander is heard asking, “Why are you hiding your faces?”  Ozturk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunsetduring Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai.  Khanbabai, who said no charges have been filed against Ozturk, filed a petition seeking her release Tuesday and then an emergency motion Wednesday.  U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani initially issued an order giving the government until Friday to answer why Ozturk was being detained. Talwani also ordered that Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice.  The government said in its response Thursday that it “will set forth the timeline” of Ozturk’s arrest and transfer from Massachusetts.

It’s situated on the outskirts of Basile, a rural town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Lafayette.  “We are in touch with local, state, and federal elected officials and hope that Rumeysa is provided the opportunity to avail herself of her due process rights,” Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement Wednesday night.  Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily last March criticizing the university’s response to student demands that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.  After the op-ed was published, Ozturk’s name, photograph and work history were published on the website Canary Mission, which describes itself as documenting people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.”   Associated Press writers Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.

US gives initial approval for Qatar to purchase MQ-9 armed drones for nearly $2 billion,https://apnews.com/article/qatar-us-mq9-reaper-drone-sale-959deaa1d8952715a9c7700b224bac3d,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. An MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is seen in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, United States, on Aug. 7, 2024. (Tech. Sgt. Joseph Pagan/U.S. Air National Guard via AP) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The United States has given an initial approval for the energy-rich Mideast nation ofQatarto buy eight armed MQ-9B Predator drones for its military, an estimated purchase worth nearly $2 billion. The State Department approval announced early Thursday for Qatar comes after Doha had been trying to purchase the drones during the Biden administration, but hadn’t gotten the OK despite serving as an interlocutor for Washington tothe Taliban in Afghanistan,Iran’s theocracyandHamas in the Gaza Strip. The immediate approval under President Donald Trump serves as a far-different starting point for his government’s relations with Qatar — particularly afterhe initially backed a four-nation boycott of Dohaduring his first term. “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,” the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement. Qatar’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear. The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them.  Under terms of the sale, Qatar would purchase eight of the drones, as well as hundreds of bombs and missiles to arm the pilotless aircraft with and the equipment necessary to fly them by satellite. General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and have an endurance of more than 30 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over the Middle East for years, in Afghanistan, Iraq andnow over Yemen during the American bombing campaign there. The drone has a land and sea version. The initial approval for Qatar, however, comes after the nearby United Arab Emirates has been waiting since 2020 to purchase up to 18 MQ-9 drones aspart of a $23 billion deal also including advanced F-35 fighter jets. Trump has a particularly close relationship with the UAE, whichreached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israelunder his administration in 2020.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

"One Tech Tip: Don’t give your email to strangers, use a decoy address instead",https://apnews.com/article/email-internet-privacy-cybersecurity-5305c01c66b7ff67c2464d83fcf2a9d8,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This May 18, 2021, photo shows a person typing on a laptop on a train in New Jersey. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) LONDON (AP) — You’ve heard of burner phones. What about burner email? So much of the internet now requires that you hand over your email address before you’re able to use any services — from an app you’ve downloaded to signing up for a newsletter or redeeming a special offer online. But who says you have to give your real email address? Next time you’re asked, consider using an email mask. There are a growing number of services that give out disguised email addresses and relay any messages to your actual address. Experts say this can be a powerful tool to safeguard privacy and security. Here are some pointers on the whys and hows of email masking: The idea behind email masking is simple. The masking service gives you a randomized address you can use as a decoy instead of your actual email. It can be a series of unrelated words, or a string of letters and numbers. When someone sends a message to the burner email, it will be automatically routed to your address without anyone knowing. Providers include privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo’s Email Protection service, Firefox Relay from browser maker Mozilla, email service FastMail and independent services like Addy.io. The encrypted service Proton Mail offers email masking with its password manager and standalone SimpleLogin service. There are many others. It’s one of the features Apple offers users subscribing to its iCloud+ or Apple One services. When you’re using the Safari browser app on your iPhone and need to input your email, you can tap the field above the onscreen keyboard to “Hide My Email,” which then creates a random address as a substitute. It’s also available on Mac computers with the desktop Safari browser or Mail app. If you’re using a different browser or app, you can still manually create a random email address by going into your iCloud settings. Most services have a free version with basic options and a premium tier with more features. Some free services can only receive emails but not reply to them. However, an important feature users should look for is the ability to do both, said Proton CEO Andy Yen. “Maybe you never reply to a newsletter and that’s fine,” said Yen. But it’s a problem if, for example, you used your email alias to buy something online and there’s an issue with your order that the site needs to ask you about. “Then the ability to reply is actually pretty important,” he said. Most masking services have a dashboard control panel where you can view the various alias addresses you’ve activated. If you notice one starting to get a lot of spam, just turn it off. Mask your email when you want to add an extra layer of privacy or protect yourself from data leaks or unauthorized information sharing. An email mask is a “general-purpose tool that can be used in any context,” says Santiago Andrigo, principal product manager at Mozilla. However, he recommends using it in two key situations. The first is when you’re unsure what a website will do with your email address. “Masking your email gives you control — if you start receiving unwanted messages, you can easily block any emails coming to that email mask,” Andrigo said. The second scenario is “when your association with a service could reveal sensitive personal information,” he said. For example, if you join an online community for a specific medical condition or a minority group, a data breach could expose your participation. There are myriad reasons not to give out your email address to anyone who wants it. It could be sold to marketers or shady data brokers, eroding your privacy by helping them build a profile of you for legitimate or nefarious purposes. If your address ends up on the wrong mailing list, it could result in more junk or phishing emails. And if an online service is hacked, attackers could make off with logins, passwords and other personal information. Using unique passwords for all your online accounts — typically with the help of apassword manager— is good cybersecurity practice. “But the real pain point for any user is actually not the password getting leaked, but actually the email getting leaked,” said Yen. Changing your password after a data breach is standard practice but it’s a lot harder to change another piece of sensitive information, your email address — unless you’re using a mask. There are other so-called hacks that you might have heard about. You could set up a throwaway account with a free email service like Gmail or Yahoo. But it’s tedious to do this. Some Gmail users add a plus sign and an extra phrase or combination of characters between their username and the @ sign. It helps track who’s sharing your address as well as filter messages. But “from a privacy standpoint, that does nothing,” said Yen. “Because people can just simply take away the plus and get your original address.” Email masks use their servers to relay message traffic between the sender and the recipient. So how can you be sure those servers are private? Look for reputable providers that promise not to keep your messages. If you’re shopping around for an email masking service, Yen advises checking if it has “proper terms and conditions,” a privacy policy and is based in a jurisdiction where it could be legally held accountable. “We state very clearly we’re not keeping a copy of anything that passes through our servers,” Yen said. Firefox Relay says in its FAQs that it does not “read or store any of your messages.” “In the event that an email cannot be delivered to you, we will keep it on our servers and delete it after it has been delivered (in no event will we hold onto it for more than three days),” it says. Apple says it “doesn’t read or process any of the content” in email messages that pass through Hide My Email except for standard spam filtering. “All email messages are deleted from our relay servers after they’re delivered to you, usually within seconds,” the iPhone maker says.

(AP Photo/Michael Casey)                   SOMERVILLE, Mass. (AP) — A Turkish national and doctoral student at Tufts University has been detained byU.S. Department of Homeland Securityagents without explanation, her lawyer said Wednesday. Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville on Tuesday night when she was stopped, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a petition filed in Boston federal court. Video obtained by The Associated Press appears to show six people, their faces covered, taking away Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed. “We’re the police,” members of the group are heard saying in the video. A man is heard asking, “Why are you hiding your faces?” Khanbabai said Ozturk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunsetduring Ramadan. “We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of,” Khanbabai said in a statement. Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said.  Neighbors said they were rattled by the arrest, which happened at 5:30 p.m. on a residential block. “It looked like a kidnapping,” said Michael Mathis, a 32-year-old software engineer whose surveillance camera captured the arrest. “They approach her and start grabbing her with their faces covered. They’re covering their faces. They’re in unmarked vehicles.” Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement that the school learned that authorities detained an international graduate student and the student’s visa had been terminated. “The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,” Kumar said. Hundreds of people gather in Somerville, Mass., on March 26, 2025, to demand the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, who was arrested by federal agents Tuesday night. (AP Photo/Michael Casey)  Kumar did not name the student, but university spokesperson Patrick Collins confirmed that Ozturk is a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley called the arrest “a horrifying violation of Rumeysa’s constitutional rights to due process and free speech.” “She must be immediately released,” Pressley said in a statement. “We won’t stand by while the Trump Administration continues to abduct students with legal status and attack our fundamental freedoms.” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell called the video “disturbing.” “Based on what we now know, it is alarming that the federal administration chose to ambush and detain her, apparently targeting a law-abiding individual because of her political views,” she said. “This isn’t public safety, it’s intimidation that will, and should, be closely scrutinized in court.” U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued an order giving the government until Friday to answer why Ozturk was being detained. Talwani also ordered that Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice. But as of Wednesday evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s online detainee locator system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana. A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa. “DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is common sense security,” the spokesperson told the AP. Ozturk was one of four students last March who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university’s response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Friends said Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the piece was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission, a website that says it documents people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.” The op-ed was the only cited example of “anti-Israel activism” by Ozturk. Students and faculty elsewhere also have recently had visas revoked or been blocked from entering the U.S. because theyattended demonstrationsorpublicly expressed support for Palestinians. PresidentDonald Trump‘s administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests. Hundreds of people gather in Somerville, Mass., on March 26, 2025, to demand the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, who was arrested by federal agents Tuesday night. (AP Photo/Michael Casey)  Hundreds of people demonstrated in a park later Wednesday, with speaker after speaker demanding her release and accusing both major political parties of failing to protect immigrants and stand up for Palestinians. “Free Rumeysa Ozturk now,” the crowd chanted, along with traditional protest slogans such as “Free, free Palestine.” Many held Palestinian flags and homemade signs supporting her and opposing ICE. Zoi Andalcio, a Somerville business owner, said he came out with his wife and 3-year-old son to speak against the “maddening” arrest of Ozturk and others. “I’m outraged like everybody else about these disappearances, kidnappings of legal noncitizens, who may or may not have spoken out against the atrocious foreign policy of the United States government,” Andalcio said. Roz Nazzaro, who held a sign that read “Hands Off,” said she fears the country is heading into an era of “Nazism” in which just disappear. “There is no distinction between undocumented immigrants, documented immigrants, green cards,” said Nazzaro, a retired college administrator from Winchester, Massachusetts. “It’s going to be the citizens next, if you’re the wrong color, wear a hijab.” Before attending Tufts, Ozturk obtained a master’s from the Developmental Psychology program at Teachers College at Columbia University in New York, according to an alumni spotlight article in 2021. Reyyan Bilge, a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend, described Ozturk as a “soft spoken, kind and gentle soul,” deeply focused on research and not closely involved in the campus protests. The two first met at Istanbul Sehir University, where Bilge supervised her thesis, before working on cognitive research and publishing papers together. They remained close after Ozturk arrived in the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship in 2018. “Over the 10 years I’ve known her, she’s never spoken badly to anyone else, let alone being antisemitic or racist,” Bilge said. The Turkish Embassy in Washington said it was keeping in regular contact with Ozturk’s family, monitoring the situation closely and engaged in “initiatives” with the State Department and ICE. It added in a statement on the social platform X that it was making “every effort” to provide consular services and legal support to protect its citizens’ rights.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)     ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump revealed his intentions to reshape the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order Thursday that targets funding to programs with “divisive narratives” and “improper ideology.” Trump said there has been a “concerted and widespread” effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing “objective facts” with a “distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.” He signed an executive order putting Vice President JD Vance in charge of an effort to “remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo. Trump’s order specifically names the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Women’s History Museum, which is in development. “Museums in our Nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,” the order said. Representatives for the Smithsonian did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The Smithsonian Institution is the world’s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington. The institution was established with funds from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found “at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jerome Delay, File)           CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — An old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression and has now been decried byElon Muskand others aspromoting the killing of whiteswas back in the headlinesin South Africaand the subject of an order by its highest court Thursday. The song has been contentious for years in South Africa because of its central lyrics “kill the Boer” and “shoot the Boer” — with Boer a word that refers to a white farmer. It has mainly been sung in modern-day South Africa by Black leaders of a small, far-left opposition party at political rallies. The party did so again last Friday, prompting the South African-born Musk to write on X that it was “actively promoting white genocide,” his latest of a number of posts over the years criticizing the song and elevating the issue. The party that sometimes sings the song, the Economic Freedom Fighters, has said it commemorates the fight against apartheid and shouldn’t be taken literally.  There have been several court cases over whether the song constitutes hate speech and is an incitement to violence against whites in post-apartheid South Africa. It was declared hate speech by a court more than a decade ago, but that ruling was overturned in 2022, when a judge said there was no proof it incited violence. On Thursday, the Constitutional Court rejected an application bya group representing some of South Africa’s white minorityto appeal the latest ruling and get the song outlawed. It was the second time an appeal by the group had failed. Billionaire Musk,an influential adviserof U.S. President Donald Trump, grew up in South Africa and finished high school there, but left before apartheid ended in 1994. He has cited the song as an example of how the current Black-led government in his homeland is allowing anti-white hate, andTrump punished South Africain an executive order last month that cut all U.S. funding to the country and accused it of “hateful rhetoric and government actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.” The South African government said the executive order is based on misinformation and there is no persecution of white people, who make up around 7% of the population but are still on average far richer than Blacks more than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule. The song has especially been condemned in South Africa by a group representing Afrikaners — aspecific white minoritywho are descended from Dutch and French colonial settlers. The word Boer is used colloquially for an Afrikaner and the song’s roots stem from the fact that Afrikaners were at the heart of the racist white apartheid government. The Afrikaner group, known as AfriForum, has long taken offense to the “shoot the Boer” lyrics and said Thursday it condemned the Constitutional Court’s decision to reject its appeal and instead “legalize calls for the murder of Afrikaners and farmers.” In response, AfriForum would expand its 177 private neighborhood and farm security patrols, it said. It also said it believed there was an “increase in ideologically driven judges,” a rare criticism of South Africa’s courts, which are largely well-respected. AfriForum recently traveled to the U.S. to meet with Trump administration officials, it said, and has lobbied conservatives in the U.S. to take notice of its cause for years. Experts say there is no evidence of whites being targeted for violence in South Africa, although white farmers are sometimes victims of violent attacks in their homes just as many other races are in a country which hasa desperately high crime rateand an average of 70 homicides a day. This week, the spokesman for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told the Netwerk24 news outlet that the official crime statistics “proved that there are no mass killings of farmers in South Africa.” The “Shoot the Boer” song is used now as a criticism that South Africa has not delivered a better life for millions of impoverished Black people, the Economic Freedom Fighters’fiery and often controversial leadersaid in testimony in one of the court cases. Still, the song has revived racial tensions in a country that largely was successful in reconciling in the years after the segregation of apartheid ended in 1994. The decision by the Constitutional Court to reject an appeal against the song’s use was also criticized Thursday by the Democratic Alliance, South Africa’s second biggest party and a member of the government coalition alongside Ramaphosa’s African National Congress. “The inflammatory “Kill the Boer” chant has no place in our society, regardless of any legal ruling on its constitutionality,” the Democratic Alliance said.

(AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File)         University of Melbourne hydrology professor Dongryeol Ryu and his collaborator Ki-Weon Seo were on a train to visit Ryu’s family when they found something startling. Stopped at a station for technical issues, Seo had pulled out his computer to pass the time with some work when a result popped up in their data that Ryu could hardly believe: It suggested a “remarkable” amount of Earth’s water stored on land had been depleted. “At first we thought, ‘That’s an error in the model,’” Ryu said. After a year of checking, they determined it wasn’t. Their paper,published Thursday in the journal Science,finds that global warming has notably reduced the amount of water that’s being stored around the world in soil, lakes, rivers, snow and other places, with potentially irreversible impacts on agriculture and sea level rise. The researchers say the significant shift of water from land to the ocean is particularly worrisome for farming, and hope their work will strengthen efforts to reduce water overuse.

(AP Photo/Edmar Barros, File)  Earth’s soil moisture dropped by over 2,000 gigatons in roughly the last 20 years, the study says. For context, that’s more than twice Greenland’s ice loss from 2002 to 2006, the researchers noted. Meanwhile, the frequency of once-in-a-decade agricultural and ecological droughts has increased, global sea levels have risen and the Earth’s pole has shifted. Ryu and his colleagues used three different data sources to verify that Earth storing less water on land than it once did. He also said their results reveal a deeper truth about the land, one farmers have to contend with frequently: When a big, dramatic rainfall event comes after a drought, sometimes leading to huge floods, that doesn’t mean the water stored underground has recovered.  “It seems that lands lost their elasticity to recover the previous level,” he said. Fishers look for a spot to collect their catch in Cabo de la Vela, Colombia, Feb. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Ivan Valencia, File)  Whether that elasticity ever returns will depend on whether humans take action on climate change and significantly change water use, the researchers say. The increasing heat stress on plants means they need more water. Agriculture, particularly irrigated agriculture, continues to draw up more water than it can afford. And humans are continuing to emit greenhouse gases without a strong effort to reverse course. “There are long-term climate changes that have happened in the past and presumably could occur in the future that could reverse the trend described, but probably not in our lifetimes,” said Katharine Jacobs, a University of Arizona professor of environmental science who wasn’t involved in the study. “Because greenhouse gases will continue to cause global warming well into the future, the rate of evaporation and transpiration is not likely to reduce any time soon.” The study also confirms an explanation for a slight wobble in the rotation of the Earth — it’s being driven by the changing moisture levels of the planet. “When I read this thing, I was very excited,” said Luis Samaniego, a professor of hydrology and data science at the University of Potsdam who wrotean overview commentary discussing the findings in Science.“It’s a fascinating puzzle of all disciplines that came at the right moment to verify something that was not possible before.” A fisher rows his Shikara, or traditional wooden boat, on his way home during sunset at the Dal Lake, in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Feb. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File)  But Samaniego stressed that the finding isn’t only fascinating; it’s a wake-up call. Imagine the planet’s wobble like an electrocardiogram for the Earth, he said. Seeing this result is like detecting an arrhythmia. Choosing not to listen to the doctor — “that’s what we are playing around with at the moment,” he said.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst, File)       NEW YORK (AP) — Salman Rushdiehas a collection of novellas and short stories coming out this fall, his first published fiction since beingstabbed repeatedly and hospitalized in 2022. Random House announced Thursday that Rushdie’s “The Eleventh Hour,” billed by the publisher as “five interlinked stories and novellas that explore the eternal mysteries of the eleventh hour of life,” will be released Nov. 4. According to Random House, Rushdie’s new book will include such “unforgettable characters” as a “musical prodigy with a magical gift,” the ghost of a Cambridge don who helps a student “avenge the tormentor of his lifetime” and a literary mentor who has mysteriously died. “The Eleventh Hour” is set in three parts of the world where Rushdie has lived: India, England and the U.S. “The three novellas in this volume, all written in the last 12 months, explore themes and places that have been much on my mind — mortality, Bombay, farewells, England (especially Cambridge), anger, peace, America. And Goya and Kafka and Bosch as well,” Rushdie said in a statement released through Random House. “I’m happy that the stories, very different from one another in setting, story, and technique, nevertheless manage to be in conversation with one another, and with the two stories that serve as prologue and epilogue to this threesome. I have come to think of the quintet as a single work, and I hope readers may see and enjoy it in the same way.” Rushdie’s fiction, notably the Booker Prize-winning “Midnight’s Children,” has brought him his greatest acclaim. His other novels include “Shame,” “The Moor’s Last Sigh” and “Victory City,” which he completed shortly before the stabbing on a lecture stage at the Chautauqua Institution in western New York. In February, the 77-year-old Rushdie returned to the area andtestified in the trialagainst his assailant, Hadi Matar.A jury found Matar guiltyof assault and attempted murder, convictions that could lead to up to 25 years in prison. The judge has set sentencing for April 23.  Rushdie’s memoir about the attack,“Knife,”was published last year and was a finalist for a National Book Award. But he has spoken of fiction as a sign of further healing and restored imaginative powers, whether after being forced into hiding in 1989 because of the fatwa calling for his death over the alleged blasphemy of the novel “The Satanic Verses” or recovering from the attack three years ago that blinded him in one eye and caused lasting nerve damage. Promoting “Knife” in 2024, Rushdietold The Associated Pressthat before writing the memoir, he had attempted fiction. But he acknowledged that the assault had become impossible to ignore. “I didn’t want to write this book,” he said of “Knife” at the time. “I actually wanted to get back to fiction, and I tried and it just seemed stupid. I just thought, ‘Look, something very big happened to you.’”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said this week it will retest 4,000 DNA samples and open an internal investigation after learning that it used potentially flawed test kits for eight months. Sheriff’s officials said Wednesday that a test kit manufacturer sent a letter in August warning the department to stop using certain kits that were prone to giving incomplete results. However, the letter was received by a civilian employee who didn’t discard the kits or send them back, according to a department statement. The department used the flawed kits from July through February, testing thousands of samples from criminal investigations. The problem was discovered Monday when a supervisor at the department’s Scientific Services Bureau found the manufacturer’s letter. The department said it has opened an internal investigation to assess how much the faulty kits have affected criminal cases, and will retest some 4,000 DNA samples. “We take the integrity of our criminal investigations and the reliability of our forensic testing very seriously,” Sheriff Robert Luna said in a statement. “The Sheriff’s Department is working diligently to assess the impact and to prevent such situations from occurring again.” Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said his office had begun working with the sheriff’s department to determine the extent of the problem. Sheriff’s officials said the bad tests might have led to incomplete results, but they are “not likely to have falsely identified any individual.” The department declined to name the manufacturer.

She’s the co-founder of the home management app Coexist, which helps families collaborate at home. In addition to leading by example, she has these suggestions: — Pick your battles and start small. “Focus on pointing out one habit — like composting, reducing single-use plastics or taking public transit — and build up from there,” she said. — Frame sustainability around the other person’s priorities. “If they don’t care about sustainability, focus on what they do care about. Many eco-friendly choices also save money, cut down on clutter or make daily life more efficient. For example,meal planningreduces food waste and saves money.” — Make it easy. “Small shifts like keeping reusable bags in the car or setting up a simple recycling system can make sustainable choices feel automatic rather than like extra work.” — Respect the other person’s boundaries. “If someone is resistant to a particular habit, it helps to take a step back and focus on what’s working rather than forcing the issue.

(AP Photo/Jerome Delay, File) GENEVA (AP) — The head of leading vaccines group Gavi alliance said Thursday it has not received confirmation from the U.S. government that it might be losing more than $1 billion in pledged funding as part of a reported proposal by U.S. authorities to cut support for international aid groups. According to a leaked 281-page spreadsheet issued by the United States Agency for International Aid this week, the U.S. plans to terminate 5,341 awards to dozens of groups it had previously supported, including theGavi alliance, a global vaccines group that helpsimmunizemore than half the world’s children against infectious diseases. The spreadsheet was first reported by The New York Times. “We have not received a termination notice from the U.S. government,” said Dr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s Chief Executive. In a statement on Thursday, Nishtar said Gavi was “engaging with the White House and Congress,” hoping to secure the $300 million approved by Congress for their activities this year, as well as longer-term funding. Nishtar said that a cut to Gavi’s funding would be “disastrous,” potentially resulting in more than 1 million deaths from preventable diseases. The U.S. had pledged to provide more than $1.5 billion through 2030 to Gavi, founded in 2000 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the World Bank. The Geneva-based group says it has helped vaccinate more than 1 billion children in 78 poorer countries against diseases including measles, Ebola andmalaria, averting nearly 19 million deaths.  Dr. David Elliman, a children’s health expert at University College London, called the reported U.S. withdrawal of funding from Gavi “cruel” and “utterly misguided.” “If diseases such as measles and TB increase anywhere in the world, it is a hazard to us all,” he said. The USAID spreadsheet lists more than 5,341 awards that the U.S. is planning to terminate to groups including UNICEF, the International Societies of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Save the Children, Doctors of the World and Action Against Hunger.

(AP Photo/Allison Joyce)                                     When Nicole Taylor and her family moved to their new home in the South Carolina mountains six months ago, the gorgeous view ofTable Rock Mountainwas the clincher.  She ended up with a porch-side seat to one of at least ahalf dozen wildfiresin the Blue Ridge Mountains ofthe Carolinas, fed by dry conditions and millions of trees that were knocked down by Hurricane Helene in 2024 and began decaying into tinderbox fuel.  Taylor watched this past weekend as smoke started to rise from the ridges across Highway 11 in Pickens County. The smoke got worse Monday, and it was pouring off the mountain Tuesday when she got a text saying she was under a mandatory evacuation.  So far no one has been hurt inthe fires, which have burned more than 20 square miles (52 square kilometers) in mostly rugged, remote forests and the popular state park that includes Table Rock Mountain. Only a few dozen structures have been damaged.  But the firefighting is slow work. Sources of water to extinguish the flames are scarce, so crews depend on buildingfire breaksto try to stop them in their tracks, using bulldozers, excavators and even shovels and saws to strip the land of fuel.  It then becomes a waiting game, making sure embers don’t jump the break and hoping for the winds to die down or — the best relief of all — a long, soaking rain.  A firefighter works to control the Black Cove Fire Wednesday, March 26, 2025, in Saluda, N.C. (AP Photo/Allison Joyce)   Hurricane Heleneslammed through Pickens County the Friday after Taylor moved into her dream home last September. The hurricane-force winds traveled hundreds of miles inland, smashing entire forests and destroying the electrical grid.  There was more than a week of what she called “prairie life.”  “We we’re like, OK, if we can make it through that, we can make it through anything. Unfortunately fire is one thing we can’t fight.”  This week Taylor decamped to wait the fire out in a hotel room in Greenville with her fiance, two children and their dogs. So far the fire has remained across the highway, but it is still too close for them to be able to go home.  “It’s been an actual whirlwind,” Taylor said of the last several days.

The Black Cove Fire is seen Wednesday, March 26, 2025, in Saluda, N.C. (AP Photo/Allison Joyce)   Wildfires are unusual in the Carolinas, but not unheard of. TheGreat Fire of 1898burned some 4,700 square miles (12,175 square kilometers) in the two states, an area roughly the size of Connecticut, said David Easterling, the director of the Technical Support Unit at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Spring is typically when blazes happen, according to Kathie Dello, North Carolina’s state climatologist.  This season the Blue Ridge Mountains are dry, having received only about two-thirds of thenormal amount of rainfallin the last six months since Hurricane Helene. March has been full of sunny, dry, windy days.  Meanwhile the risk to people and property has increased over the years thanks to a boom in popularity of the mountains as a place to live.  “North Carolina has a lot of homes in the wildland urban interface, or more people living with a higher fire risk,” Dello said.  Any trees downed by Helene that do not burn this year will still be around for future fire seasons.  “All that storm debris will be there for years to come, increasing the fire danger considerably,” Easterling said.

The Table Rock fire has consumed 7.1 square miles (18.4 square kilometers), and the one on Persimmon Ridge in Greenville County has burned 2.4 square miles (6.2 square kilometers).

The evacuation zone extended into nearby Transylvania County, North Carolina.  In North Carolina at least eight fires were burning in the mountains. The largest — the Black Cove Fire and the Deep Woods Fire in Polk County — were each more than 10% contained. The fires have scorched nearly 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) combined but have not grown for more than a day.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Lehman Franklin and his wife, Lorie Franklin, stand at the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta after Franklin’s bill to codify IVF passed the Senate on March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Charlotte Kramon)     ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia bill to codify the right to in vitro fertilization got overwhelming approval from the state Senate Thursday, setting it up to move to Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk for his signature. The House approved it last month, and the chamber will likely approve the final version Friday. Republican Rep. Lehman Franklin drew bipartisan support for his bill, which he introduced in part over concerns about access to the treatment after theAlabama Supreme Court ruledlast year that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. After multiple rounds of IVF and a plan to adopt fell through, Franklin and his wife Lorie were finally able to conceive using the treatment. They’re expecting a baby girl this summer. “We wanted to find the language to safeguard it so we didn’t have any kind of experience that other states might have had in the past,” Franklin said in an interview. “We want to get ahead of the game and make sure that we’re safe.” Lorie Franklin joined her husband in the House and Senate when each chamber voted on the bill. Some conservatives are skeptical of IVF because some embryos are discarded in the process. Franklin said floating concerns are “satellite issues that are worthy of debate,” that could be addressed separately. Legal experts say Georgia’s current law does not pose a significant threat to IVF the way Alabama’s constitution did.  A handful of states have “personhood” laws, which give rights to fertilized eggs, embryos or fetuses.Georgia’s personhood lawdefines a fetus as a person and is one of the broadest, giving rights such as tax breaks and child support to unborn children. But the Alabama ruling relied on the wording of the state’s wrongful death statute and language added to the Alabama Constitution in 2018 protecting the “rights of the unborn children.” After the ruling, Alabama’s governorsigned legislationprotecting IVF providers from legal liability. Still, the bill’s passage comesa day after a hearingon House Bill 441 that would make most abortions a homicide and recognize fetuses as people from the point of fertilization. House Republican sponsors of that bill voted in favor of Franklin’s bill protecting IVF access. But doctors told the committee the bill would bar access to IVF. “Ultimately, I don’t think they’re going to be able to go all the way with personhood and simultaneously protect IVF the way they want to,” said Duke University law professor Jolynn Dellinger in an interview last month, referring to those who want to push the laws defining personhood further. For now, though, IVF access will remain protected in Georgia. President Donald Trump has also affirmed his support for IVF access, including through anexecutive orderaiming to reduce its cost. Republican House Speaker Jon Burns made the bill to protect IVF a priority this session.

Arctic sea ice hits record low for its usual peak growth period,https://apnews.com/article/arctic-climate-change-sea-ice-loss-melt-a5c45e0d2ee81a7dfc3c816f2ee4dfac,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) A boat rides though a frozen sea inlet outside of Nuuk, Greenland, March 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)     Arctic sea ice had its weakest winter buildup since record-keeping began 47 years ago, a symptom of climate change that will have repercussions globally, scientists said Thursday. The Arctic reaches its maximum sea ice in March each year and then starts a six-month melt season. The National Snow and Ice Data Center said the peak measurement taken Saturday was 5.53 million square miles (14.33 million square kilometers) — about 30,000 square miles (80,000 square kilometers) smaller than the lowest previous peak in 2017. That’s a difference about the size of California. “Warming temperaturesare what’s causing the ice to decline,’' ice data scientist Walt Meier said. “You know, sea ice in particular is very sensitive... 31 degrees is ice skating and 33 degrees it’s swimming.” Jennifer Francis, a scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, said this is yet another ringing alarm bell in the form of a broken record. “Disappearing sea ice is a particularly worrisome story because it’s truly an early warning system alerting us about a variety of hard-to-see changes,” Francis said in an email. Scientists said warming conditions in the Arctic — the region is warming four times faster than the rest of the world — affect weather elsewhere. Pressure and temperature differences between north and south shrink. Thatweakens the jet stream, that moves weather systems along, making it dip further south with cold outbreaks and storms that oftenget stuck and rain or snow more, according to the snow and ice center and Francis.  “The warming winter atmosphere above the Arctic Circle does impact large-scale weather patterns that do influence for those of us outside the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist at the University of Manitoba. Of the smaller sea ice, Stroeve also noted that it’s not only that there’s less of it. The remaining ice is thin enough for more of it to melt quickly this summer, Stroeve said. She cautioned that a record low area in the winter doesn’t guarantee a record small area in the summer. Melting Arctic sea ice — mostly in the summer — ismaking the polar bear population smaller, weaker and hungrierbecause they rely on the sea ice to hunt from, scientists said. And winter sea ice is especially important for fisheries and seal pups, Meier said. Arctic sea ice’s biggest year since record-keeping began was 1979, at 6.42 million square miles (16.64 million square kilometers). That means since satellites began tracking it, Arctic sea ice’s winter peak has shrunk by about the size of Pakistan. When winter sea ice is doing well it can extend more than halfway down the Earth toward the equator, reach Japan, China and Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence, Meier said. Meier said sea ice extent is shrinking all four seasons, but the most important season for the overall health of the Arctic ice is the summer. That’s because ice-free waters warm up quicker, hold more energy and make fall and winter warmer and weaker. The five lowest amounts for winter peak Arctic sea ice have been since 2015. Earlier this month, Antarctica came close to breaking a record for record low sea ice — this is the time of year the region hits its minimum — and ended up with the second-lowest sea level on record. There’s more sea ice in the Antarctic in general and the two poles are timed a bit differently, but in February, global sea ice — the combination of Arctic and Antarctic — hit a record low, Meier said.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Major anti-abortion groups gathered in the nation’s capital on Thursday to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration aimed at eliminating funding forPlanned Parenthood, with some calling on Elon Musk to make the organization one of his cost-cutting targets. The anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider. More than 150 of the groups signed a letter Wednesday urging Congress to cut Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other health care centers that provide abortions through the budget reconciliation process. “Today is a historic moment where the pro-life movement stands united behind one message: Defund Planned Parenthood,” said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, as she kicked off the rally in view of the U.S. Capitol. She called on Trump and other Republicans to “defund your political enemies,” adding that the abortion lobby has long targeted Republicans. The federal Hyde Amendmentalready restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization’s 2023 annual report. Vicki Ringer, Planned Parenthood’s South Carolina director of public affairs, said claims that Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding for abortion is “an attempt to mislead the public” and emphasized Planned Parenthood’s role in providing broader reproductive health care.  “We should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,” Ringer said. Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of services besides abortion. Its most recent annual report shows that contraceptive services and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections make up the vast majority of its medical care. It also performs more cancer screening and prevention procedures than abortions, according to the report. The national group said eliminating its federal funding could put those services out of reach for millions of people and would hit low-income communities with little access to health care hardest. Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University’s Beasley School of Law, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump’s presidential victory and by Republicans winningcontrol of Congressin November. “We’re seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,” she said. Tina Whittington, executive vice president at Students for Life, said she was confident that Trump would consider cutting Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid funding and that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could be just the tool for doing it. “I’m more confident because we’re in an era where DOGE’s actions are targeting waste, fraud and abuse,” she said. “And this is a great way to do that.” The Supreme Court announced it will hear a case involvingSouth Carolina’s attempt to strip Medicaid fundingfor Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization’s funding. During a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years. Meanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states — Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina — have introduced bills this year aiming to createtax breaks for anti-abortion centers. The strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict access tomedication abortionnationwide. Rather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves afterwaffling on the issueon the campaign trail. He reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don’t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning. He also pardoned several anti-abortion activists who had been convicted of blockading abortion clinics and used wording related tofetal personhoodinan executive orderrolling back protections for transgender people. The Republican president has appointed abortion opponents to some key Cabinet positions that could affect the availability of medication abortion and contraception, Medicaid coverage for family planning services, collection of abortion-related data and abortion access for troops and veterans. In a pre-recorded message to the thousands who attendedthe March for Lifein January, Trump said he proudly stood for families and for life. Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville said during Thursday’s rally that he “truly believes President Trump is the most pro-life president in history.” “Absolutely zero taxpayer dollars should be going to abortion,” he said. “… And I know President Trump agrees.” Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said Republican control of the White House and Congress represents a unique opportunity to push for legislation targeting Planned Parenthood. “I believe this is the moment they will be defunded, and this is the blow that will bring them down,” she said. Advocates on either side of the abortion debate are waiting to see if Trump’s Department of Justice will revivethe Comstock Act, a 19th-century obscenity law, to restrict the mailing of medication abortion or other materials used for abortions. Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of defending abortion restrictions, andher confirmationwas celebrated by abortion opponents. At the Thursday rally, some passers-by shouted support for Planned Parenthood, saying the organization saves lives. Haven Wright, an 83-year-old retired entrepreneur visiting Washington to see the National Museum of African American History and Culture, happened upon the rally and noted that Planned Parenthood also provided health care for underserved communities. “They are the main doctors for many, many poor women,” she said. “They are their main resource for all kinds of reproductive health care.” Wright said she had two abortions while in her 20s, once while she had an IUD and another time after she was raped. She said she was grateful she had the “agency to get the care I needed.” “Women,” she said, “deserve a choice.” Follow the AP’s coverage of abortion athttps://apnews.com/hub/abortion.

(AP video shot by Hau Dinh/ production by Annika Wolters)                HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The taste of banh te — a steamed rice cake with an enticing filling of mushrooms and minced pork — captures the quintessence of northern Vietnamese cuisine: Humble ingredients, prepared perfectly and often enjoyed with a funkyfish saucedip.  This balance of flavors is what Quang Dung, the chef and owner of Chapter Dining in Hanoi, sought in his modern take on the dish. His version of banh te is unapologetically fancy. The steamed rice cake is enriched with pork stock and served with a raw scallop and pickled daikon shavings. Freshness comes from coriander used several ways, sweetness from fried shallot oil, and a delicate floral essence extracted from a giant water bug used in northern Vietnamese cooking.  And then, a splash of fish sauce — or nuoc mam — brings it all together in a savory broth that suffuses the dish.  “Fish sauce is one of the foundations for flavor,” he said. Dishes made with fish sauce are prepared at Chapter Dining, a fine dining restaurant, on March 1, 2025, in Hanoi, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   It’s also the basis for Vietnam’s diverse and vibrant cuisine. Just a drop of the amber liquid can transform a dish by boosting umami and savory notes. Made by fermenting fish — often anchovies that are getting harder to catch because of climate change — in salt for many months, the taste of each bottle varies depending on factors like the ratio of salt to fish or the length of fermentation.  Fish sauce is a staple across Vietnam, used in a variety of dishes. As a dipping sauce for spring rolls or savory crepes called banh xeo. In marinades for grilled meat dishes like Hanoi’s pork and noodle classic called bun cha. In salad dressings and in braised meat dishes like the southern classic where pork is cooked in bittersweet caramel and fish sauce. Much of Vietnam’s cuisine is shaped by the decades of hardship during and after the Vietnam War, but today its economy and its cities are booming. And fish sauce is finding its way into unusual applications.  A speciality cocktail made with fish sauce is displayed at the Liquid Store, on Feb. 19, 2025, in Hanoi, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   In Hanoi, fish sauce is used in some cocktails to add umami, and Dung has used it to add a Vietnamese twist to French hollandaise sauce and even flavor ice cream.  “It is very versatile,” he said. “A lot of fun to use and to explore.”  Dung’s culinary explorations began early. His mother taught him to cook at 10 so he could feed himself while his banker parents worked long hours. He learned how to make rice, fry eggs, and boil vegetables. Soon after, he was braising pork and making spicy fried rice. Growing up, he assumed everyone could cook — after all, his friends in Hanoi could. But it wasn’t until he moved to the United Kingdom as a teenager to finish high school that he realized this wasn’t the case.  He eventually studied finance in coastal Devon, but while working part-time in restaurants, he fell in love with all things food: learning from his peers, consuming cookbooks by top chefs, and spending all his savings to eat out at restaurants. “When you’re 18, you’re a sponge. You absorb everything,” he said. Fish sauce is an indelible part of Vietnam’s culture and essential for its vibrant cuisine. In small fishing villages across Vietnam’s long coast, families have made it for centuries but climate change and overfishing threaten the anchovies crucial for fish sauce production. (AP video shot by Hau Dinh/ production by Annika Wolters)  He came back to Vietnam in 2013 and got a job working in a bank. But every evening, he worked a second job — as a junior chef for a five-star hotel in Hanoi at night. He eventually quit both jobs in 2015 and started a gastropub in Hanoi. That didn’t go according to plan as he “managed to do everything wrong.” More failures followed — he calls them “lessons in my dictionary” — but in 2021 he opened Chapter Dining, a fine dining restaurant in the heart of Hanoi’s Old Quarter that celebrates local, seasonal produce and the cooking traditions of Vietnam’s mountainous north.  The restaurant, with its facade of steel slats, leads to an open kitchen where Dung and his team regularly create a 14-course tasting menu that won it a spot in the coveted Michelin Guide Hanoi in 2023 and 2024.  “I can finally call it ... my restaurant, my food, my philosophy,” he said.  Central to that philosophy is sustainability. Each menu is seasonal — warm, comforting dishes for the cold months and fresh, lighter dishes in the summer — and the ingredients are locally sourced. Given the erratic weather in the climate-vulnerable country, this means that he can’t always be sure of what produce will be available. So the menu adapts, letting nature decide, and the bottle of fish sauce is never too far away.  “Fish sauce isn’t just about saltiness. It is as much about umaminess. It is magic,” he said, adding that he hoped more people would cook with fish sauce.  A good starting point, he suggested, is to use it to add a bit of that magic to the humble omelet. Three eggs, two teaspoons of fish sauce, a heap of finely diced spring onions all beaten together. Add pork fat to a hot pan and roll the eggs around.  “And then you’ve got a very nice fish sauce omelet. That goes down really well with rice,” he said.

"Under Tennessee bill, students would be taught marriage before kids as one key to success",https://apnews.com/article/success-sequence-tennessee-marriage-e98f62b9b944daf44e204cc874f43dac,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The Tennessee state Capitol is seen Tuesday, April 23, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV, File) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee’s public schools could soon be required to teach that the keys to a successful life include following a proper sequence of events: high school, job or higher education, marriage and then children. It’s a proposal advancing inside the state’s Republican-dominant Legislature and similar to others moving in several states this year. In Tennessee, the Senate passed the legislation 25-5 on Thursday. It has several steps remaining in the House. “Some children are not privileged to recognize that or live within that,” said the bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Janice Bowling of Tullahoma. “And so in these classes, these children will be given this key to success.” Republican proponents argued the so-called success sequence could help lift people out of poverty by delaying life events, such as getting married before having children. Democratic opponents raised concerns that the instruction could indoctrinate students about matters that should be personal choices while making students who have a single parent feel bad about themselves. Republicans have brought forward similar proposals in other states, including Texas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio, according to an Associated Press analysis using thebill-tracking software Plural. In Utah, the governor has already signed a bill. Several advocacy groups are pushing for the policy change, including the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.  The Tennessee proposal would require that a family life curriculum in a public K-12 school include age-appropriate teaching about the “positive personal and societal outcomes” of the sequence. Under state law, parents can opt their children out of the family planning curriculum. Sen. London Lamar is a Memphis Democrat, a single 34-year-old mother and the daughter of a single mother. She said she knows a lot of people born into two-parent households whom she has far exceeded in life. “I think this bill is misguided, it’s very offensive, and I’m living proof that this bill has no merit,” Lamar said. Republican backers of the bill say the sequence is a goal supported by research, but it is not an absolute for everyone’s life situation. Critics of the sequence have said it oversimplifies the various factors that keep people in poverty, relying on correlation without sufficient evidence of causation.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)       PANAMA CITY (AP) — Former Panama President Ricardo Martinelli will be allowed to leave the Nicaraguan embassy where he’s been holed up for more than a year to travel to Nicaragua for humanitarian reasons, Panama Foreign Affairs Minister Javier Martínez-Acha Vásquez said Thursday. Martinelli has beeninside Nicaragua’s embassyin Panama since Panama moved to arrest him after his appeals ran out on hismoney laundering conviction. The 73-year-old former leader maintains that his prosecution has been politically motivated as he sought to run for a second term in office. Martínez-Acha Vásquez said that by leaving the embassy and going to Nicaragua, Martinelli would be able to manage his legal defense under better conditions and receive medical treatment for unspecified issues. “Given that justice’s timeline does not always coincide with health’s timeline, the Foreign Relations Ministry has decided to recognize the asylum granted to Mr. Martinelli Berrocal by the Nicaraguan government,” the foreign affairs minister said. Martinelli has until midnight on March 31 to leave Panama. Martinelli is a businessman and supermarket magnate who governed Panama from 2009 to 2014. In 2023, he won his party’s nomination to seek the presidency again. However, he was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to more than 10 years in prison and fined $19 million. Once the Supreme Court denied his appeal, he was ineligible to run.  Ultimately Martinelli supported his running mate, current President José Raúl Mulino. At the time, Mulino said that Martinelli would remain on the ballot and return to Panama once he had won. Mulino said a month ago that he was going to meet with Nicaragua’s new ambassador to Panama and that permission for Martinelli to travel to Nicaragua was among the issues they would discuss. Nicaragua granted Martinelli political asylum in February 2024. Panama had refused to grant Nicaragua permission to move Martinelli to Nicaragua. So Martinellistayed in the political mixusing social media to advance his agenda during last year’s presidential campaign. Just before Thursday’s announcement, Martinelli posted a video to Instagram in which he said that a special police force had surrounded the embassy and was checking everyone who entered. It was later reposted to X. “I don’t know if they want to assault the embassy. I don’t know if they want to do something improper to me and I don’t know the reasons,” Martinelli said. But an AP journalist outside the embassy saw only two police pickup trucks with fewer than a dozen normal police officers in them.

Penn hired Fran McCaffery as its men’s basketball coach on Thursday, two weeks after he was fired at Iowa in a season wherethe Hawkeyeswon their fewest games and had their lowest Big Ten regular-season finish in seven years. Penn fired Steve Donahue earlier this month after the Quakers went 8-19 in his ninth season on the job. McCaffery played three seasons with the Quakers and led the Ivy League in assists (105) and steals (51) as a senior in 1981-82. Penn went 36-6 in Ivy League play across McCaffery’s three seasons, winning three conference titles. He played in two NCAA Tournaments. McCaffery hopes he can find that kind of success again at Penn, which has made the tournament only twice since Fran Dunphy left after 2006. Penn made one NCAA Tournament appearance during Donahue’s tenure when it won the Ivy League Tournament on their home court at the Palestra in Philadelphia in 2018. As a No. 16 seed, the team lost to top-seeded Kansas in the first round. The Quakers went 131-130 overall and 63-63 in conference play since Donahue took over in 2015. “My vision is to return Penn to prominence in the Ivy League and beyond and bring an exciting style of play to the Palestra,” McCaffery said. The 65-year-old McCaffery was Iowa’s all-time wins leader and longest-tenured coach in program history after 15 years at the school. McCaffery was head coach at Lehigh, UNC Greensboro and Siena before former Iowa athletic director Gary Barta hired him in 2010. He led the Hawkeyes to eight 20-win seasons and won a game in four of seven NCAA Tournament appearances from 2012-13 to 2022-23.  McCaffery is 548-384 overall, a .588 winning percentage. Iowa was ranked as high as No. 3 nationally during both the 2016 and 2021 seasons. The Hawkeyes were ranked for 16 consecutive weeks in 2019, the final nine weeks of the 2020 season, went wire-to-wire in 2021 in the top 15 of the AP Poll for the first time since the 1989 campaign, and ranked No. 16 in the final poll in 2022. “Fran has had success at every level of Division I and is passionate about restoring our program to glory,” Penn athletic director Alanna Wren said Thursday. “His energy and enthusiasm for leading young men was apparent throughout the process and he has proven to be committed to player development and relationship-building with his student-athletes throughout his storied career.” Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)                         ASSISI, Italy (AP) — Pilgrims have been pouring into this medieval hilltop town to venerate not only two of the Catholic Church’smost celebrated saints, Francisand Clare, but its newest —Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint, who will be canonized on April 27. “St. Francis, St. Clare, of course, important saints who marked an epoch – but that’s far removed from today’s teens. Carlo is like the kids,” said Maria Rosario Riccio, a mother and educator who was visiting Acutis’ shrine recently with a 50-strong parish youth group from southern Italy. “He’s a near-saint of our time, who can show teens that it’s possible to love Jesus while being a regular youth.” The group lined up to enter the Santuario della Spogliazione — a somber church, also known as Santa Maria Maggiore, marking the spot where more than 800 years ago St. Francis renounced his family’s wealth. There, they prayed by the monument where Acutis’ body is on view, wearing jeans, a sweatshirt and sneakers. On that Saturday, hundreds filed past — a priest and his parishioners from the Azores islands, a nun from Colombia and her Passionist sisters, a family with two teens from near Venice. Someclutched rosaries, others took selfies or touched the protective glass in front of the seemingly sleeping young man, who died of leukemia at 15 in 2006 and is generating a devotion that astonishes even Assisi’s bishop. “I’m seeing here a volcano of grace erupting … I can’t believe my eyes,” said the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino. When he became bishop two decades ago, the church next to his residence just off the main street was “forgotten” by the throngs that visited the monumental Basilica of St. Francis.  Over the last year, more than a million pilgrims paid homage to Acutis, Sorrentino said, drawn by “his smiling way of living our faith.” The teen’s happy image, usually in a red polo shirt and carrying a backpack, is as popular in souvenir shops across town as Francis in his simple brown habit. One store owner picked up a blessed icon the first time she went to the shrine and keeps it glued to her cash register. “I was really curious about this new saint who attracts youth,” Silvia Balducci said. Both the church and his family describe Acutis as an exceptionally devout but otherwise regular Italian boy, who’s working miracles after his untimely death precisely by drawing youth to faith whenmost of his contemporaries are abandoningorganized religion. “Carlo wasn’t an alien, he was a normal person. But if it’s illuminated by the light of Christ, a life becomes extraordinary,” his mom, Antonia Salzano Acutis, told The Associated Press. “We always pray to the saints, and in the end, what did saints do? They opened the doors of their lives to Christ.” She quoted one of her son’s favorite phrases: “’Everyone is born an original, but many die photocopies.” “The saint is one who didn’t die like a photocopy, who realized that project of holiness that God established in eternity for each of us, as we all should,” she said. Not an observant Catholic herself when she had him, Acutis used to joke with her husband that their young son was “a little Buddha” because of his unselfishness, attention to others, and cheerful obedience. He developed a precocious interest in faith, such as wanting to enter every church to “say hi” to Jesus and Mary. Later, he started attending Mass,adoring the Blessed Sacramentand praying the rosary daily — while also entertaining with jokes his friends who were less interested in religion and more into going to nightclubs with their girlfriends and smoking an occasional joint. “This was a bit of a way of hiding his faith life, because Carlo knew that his friends couldn’t understand,” his mother said. “But Carlo was a witness, a silent witness through the value of friendship, through the value of generosity, helping his classmates in school, defending the teens who were bullied.” Acutis often helped the homeless and was uninterested in the trappings common for a wealthy child in Milan, one of Europe’sfashion and business capitals. He asked his parents to donate to the poor what they would have spent for a second pair of sneakers for him, and insisted he wanted to teach catechism at his parish instead of going on skiing holidays at fancy resorts like his peers. That denial of privilege is a parallel with St. Francis, to whom Acutis was so devoted that he asked to be buried in Assisi, said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent most of his religious career there and heads the pontifical committee for World Children’s Day. “And there are more similarities with St. Francis. St. Francis left the churches and went to the squares to preach. Carlo Acutis prophetically realized that today the public squares are online, on the Web,” Fortunato said. “That’s where youth are, that’s where people are, so he lives and brings the Gospel in those squares. That’s one of the reasons why he will become the patron of the Web, Internet and social media.” Particularly devout to the eucharist and wanting to share the Catholic belief that Jesus is literally present in it, Acutis created an online exhibit about miracles where the bread and wine became flesh and blood throughout the centuries. It’s been used in thousands of parishes worldwide, his mother said. For her, his being “a bridge to Jesus” — even in his terminal illness, which he faced without complaining, certain of eternal life — is a more important legacy than any miracles or supernatural signs. To become a saint, however,miracles do need to be attested. One in Acutis’ canonization process was the healing of a Costa Rican student from a bicycle accident in Italy after her mother prayed to him, Sorrentino said. Sabina Falcetta goes often to Acutis’ shrine from the nearby city of Perugia with a group of fellow mothers to pray for their children. “Carlo Acutis gives us peace,” she said. “Most importantly he gives us the certainty that God is a good father. And you can’t ask for more.” As she talked outside the sanctuary, a Confirmation group from Lake Garda in northern Italy was praying in a circle by a cutout of Acutis in his jeans and backpack standing by a larger-than-life monstrance. One of the catechists, Veronica Abraham, said she had been teaching about both St. Francis and Acutis, focusing on the teen’s charity and his custom of sitting down to chat with anyone who looked lonely, “since even a ciao is important for those who are alone.” Her son Mario Girardi, 13, said he was really struck by the fact that Acutis — when only a couple of years older than him — “spoke with everyone, didn’t let anything bother him but helped everyone.” While he’s not considering the priesthood, Girardi does go to church every Sunday and plans to “always stay in this mindset” — maybe even going to daily Mass. Would he want to become a saint, too? “Well, let’s hope. Yes, right? Never say never, who knows,” the boy said, grinning.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File)     NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City rapper who joined President Donald Trumpduring a campaign rallylast year has pleaded guilty to attempted murder and conspiracy charges after prosecutors say he used earnings from his music career to fuel gang violence in Brooklyn. Sheff G, whose legal name is Michael Williams, agreed to serve five years in prison as part of the plea entered in a Brooklyn court Wednesday, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said. “Notoriety could not shield this defendant from justice,” Gonzalez said in a statement. “He used his fame to fund and direct violence, terrorizing our streets.” The 26-year-old rapper, whose songs and videos have millions of YouTube views and Spotify streams, was among those arrested in connection with a long-term investigation into gang-related shootings in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. More than 30 purported members of the 8 Trey Crips and the street gang’s affiliate, the 9 Ways gang, have so far been indicted. Among them is Tegan Chambers, a rapper known as Sleepy Hallow who also appeared on stage with Trump and Sheff G during the May 23, 2024, rally in the Bronx. Prosecutors say Sheff G showered money and jewelry on gang members as they battled rivals in Brooklyn. They say the rapper even acted as a getaway driver on at least one occasion, chauffeuring three codefendants to and from a 2021 shooting that targeted a rival but instead hit two bystanders.  Sheff G also treated Sleepy Hallow and others to a lavish dinner at a Manhattan steakhouse to celebrate a 2020 shooting that killed a purported rival gang member and injured five others, according to prosecutors. Surveillance videos, social media posts, text messages and more document the criminal activities, and the two rappers also boasted about their misdeeds in their songs, Gonzalez’s office said. Sheff G’s lawyer Arthur Aidala said Thursday that his client decided the plea deal was in the “best interest of everyone involved” after “careful review of the evidence and hard consideration.” The rapper is due to be sentenced Aug. 13. Sleepy Hallow, whose layer didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment, is due in court April 11. The two were among the notable names Trump touted during his campaign stops as he worked to woo Black voters by comparing his legal challenges to racialprejudice in the criminal justice system. “One thing I want to say: They are always going to whisper your accomplishments and shout your failures,” Sheff G told the Bronx crowd last May after being invited on stage by the Republican candidate. “Trump is going to shout the wins for all of us.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader via AP) TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian state media said Thursday that Iran has sent an official response to a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump to the Iranian supreme leader that was seen as an attempt to jumpstart talks over Tehran’s nuclear program. The Iranian response was “appropriately sent through Oman” on Wednesday, state-run IRNA news agency quoted Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi as saying. No details have been released of the Iranian response nor the contents of Trump’s letter to 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which came as the Trump administration levied new sanctions on Iran as part of its “maximum pressure” campaign. Araghchi, which not discussing details of the letters, said that Iran’s policy “remains firm on not engaging in direct negotiations under maximum pressure and military threats.” However, he said that indirect talks, which have taken place under previous administrations, could continue. Trump letter was handed to Iranian officials by Anwar Gargash, a senior Emirati diplomat, while he visited Tehran on March 12, 2025. Trump has sought to launch talks on Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. In addition to sanctions, Trump also has suggested that military action against Iran remained a possibility, while emphasizing he still believed a new deal could be reached.

Georgia’s Brian Kemp would tie for the nation’s top-paid governor under a pay-raise proposal,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-governor-officials-pay-kemp-york-hochul-340d3c0711605018bb3ee74984934ddf,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp addresses the Chamber of Commerce at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, Jan. 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Amy, File) ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s Brian Kemp could tie New York’s Kathy Hochul for the highest-paid state governor under a proposal made Thursday. State senators agreed to amend House Bill 86 to give big pay raises to most of Georgia’s statewide elected officials, who are all Republicans. The bill would also raise pay for judges on the state Supreme Court and other statewide courts. The measure would raise Kemp’s pay from the $182,000 he made in the budget year that ended June 30 to $250,000. According to figures compiled by New York state government, that would tie Hochul, a Democrat for the most any governor is paid. Maine Gov. Janet Mills makes the least, at $70,000 a year, according to the figures. The House must agree to the bill in the closing days of Georgia’s 2025 legislative session before it would go to Kemp for his signature or veto, and changes could still be made. Rep. Rob Leverett, an Elberton Republican who sponsors the underlying measure, said he was “caught completely flat-footed” by the amendment and was still trying to decide whether he supported it. Kemp had no advance notice of the proposal, said spokesperson Garrison Douglas, who otherwise declined to comment. State Sen. John Albers, a Roswell Republican, said statewide official salaries need updating, noting that Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens is now in line to earn a higher salary than Kemp.  “I believe it’s time that we stood up and said it’s the right thing to do because it’s woefully out of date,” said Albers, who made the surprise proposal as Georgia’s yearly legislative session nears its end. Other statewide officials including Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger would see their pay increase to $200,000 a year. So would Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper, Insurance Commissioner John King, incoming Labor Commissioner Bárbara Rivera Holmes and state schools Superintendent Richard Woods. Currently, those officials earn a range of salaries between the $99,000 that Jones made last year and the $146,000 that Carr earned last year. Also included in the bill is House Speaker Jon Burns, who would see his pay rise from $106,000 to $200,000. The raises would begin July 1, although some senators suggested any change would be more appropriate when officials are sworn in for new terms after upcoming 2026 elections. Jones said if the measure became law, he would donate his raise back to the state treasury. “Those things need to be vetted better than that,” Jones said immediately after the measure passed. Raffensperger declined to comment while a spokesperson for Carr did not immediately respond to text messages seeking comment.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart, file) State Rep. James Burchett, R-Waycross, speaks during a debate, March 20, 2025 in Atlanta. (Miguel Martinez /Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, file)     ATLANTA (AP) — The second part of Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’stop priorityto limit lawsuits and large verdicts won approval Thursday from the House. The full package, also called tort reform, is set to hit his desk in the coming weeks. The bill, which seeks tolimit predatory activityfrom third parties and foreign adversaries who invest in litigation, got overwhelming approval in the Senate and bipartisan support in the House, passing 98-69. But those moves come as lawmakers grapple with the fallout from political disputes over the first half of the proposal. Senate Bill 69 requires third-party entities that invest in litigation to register with the Department of Banking and Finance and bans foreign adversaries and governments from investing in litigation, among other reforms. It also limits how much the funders of litigation can influence civil litigation proceedings and the people involved. “What this bill does is puts regulation and parameters around an industry that is, frankly, wide open at this point,” House Republican Majority Whip Rep. James Burchett said Thursday. The first part of the package, Senate Bill 68, won narrowfinal approvalin the House last week and contains a series of changes that will overhaul Georgia’s litigation landscape, including limiting when property and business owners can be held accountable for injuries on their property. Kemp said businesses are struggling to keep up with the costs of frivolous lawsuits and that insurance rates would stabilize with a balanced legal landscape, although theevidence for that assertion is uncertain.  Kemp promised the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, a top ally, that he wouldtake actionto limit lawsuits in 2023. Senate Bill 68, which passed this year,generated an uproarfrom lawyers and survivors of sexual abuse, human trafficking and violence who said the bill would stop them and wronged Georgians from getting justice in court. Still, the billpicked up supportfrom one Senate Democrat and three House Democrats. State Rep. Stacey Evans, an Atlanta Democrat and lawyer, saw the bill as a handout to insurance companies and businesses, as did many of her Democratic colleagues. She said after it passed that she was disappointed in her colleagues who voted for it. “Hard decisions are hard because you have to look people in the eye that you disappoint. I don’t want to disappoint those victims,” Evans said. “But guess what? Those victims won’t be here every day. But the Chamber will be here. Insurance companies will be here. And I think too many of my colleagues are worried about walking down the halls looking them in the eye and not worried about the people back home.” A day later, Democratic state Rep. Mack Jackson, a Black Democrat who grew up in the 1960s and has previously split with his party, voted against the bill. He compared an unnamed Democratic colleague who donated to his reelection campaign with segregation-era figures George Wallace and Theophilus Eugene “Bull” Connor. “I realized that somewhere in her subconscious mind, she thought that she had bought me and my freedom to choose,” Jackson said, adding that he returned her money because he doesn’t “want anyone to think that they own me.” “The chains and shackles that she thought that she had on me had to be broken,” Jackson said. “Because in that very instance, I realized that she only tolerated me as long as I went along to get along.” He then said other colleagues had approached him about money they donated to his campaign, and he plans to refund them. On the other side, Republican state Rep. Vance Smith lost his job as the CEO of the Harris County Chamber of Commerce after voting against the first part of Kemp’s package, although he voted for the second part. Smith teared up on the House floor Tuesday as he talked about what happened. Democrats gathered behind him in support. “I want to thank you. This is a family in here, and you won’t believe the calls and texts I’ve had,” Smith said. Before the Senate vote on the first part of his proposal, Kemp threatened Republican detractors that he would fund primary opponents against them.

All Rights Reserved. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts speaks at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, in Lincoln, Neb., Sept. 19, 2014. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, stands for a portrait at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, March 16, 2023. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via AP, File)     After Chief Justice John Robertsrebuked callsthis week by the Trump administration to impeach judges, social media users falsely claimed that he and other high-level legal professionals are part of a “secretive, invite only club.” Many questioned the motives of members, hinting at coordinated efforts to oppose President Donald Trump. Among those named was U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who Trump had demanded be removed from the bench for his order blocking deportation flights that the president was carrying out by invokingwartime authoritiesfrom 18th century law. But the group in question — the American Inns of Court — is hardly secretive given its large public presence, and there is no evidence that members are involved in nefarious activities targeting Trump. Roberts is no longer an active member and Boasberg is the president of a chapter that is no longer affiliated with the parent association. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Roberts, Boasberg and other powerful legal professionals are part of a secret, invite-only club that is working against Trump. THE FACTS: This is false. Roberts was a member of the Edward Coke Appellate Inn of Court chapter of the organization prior to his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005, but he is not currently an active member of the organization, according to Executive Director Malinda Dunn. Boasbergis the presidentof the Edward Bennett Williams Inn of Court, but the chapter disaffiliated from the parent association about 10 years ago when it decided it no longer wanted to pay dues to the national group, Dunn said. He was an active member prior to the chapter’s decision to operate independently.  Information on the American Inns of Court isreadily availableonline. Chapters also have their own websites, which often include details about programs they host for members, typically focused on networking, education and mentorship. Dunn said that members have a wide range of political opinions, but that the organization itself is “assiduously apolitical.” Some on social media, however, baselessly claimed that there is more to the group than meets the eye. “It has been revealed that Chief Justice John Roberts is part of an elite, invite-only group called the American Inns of Court, alongside some of the most openly anti-Trump judges in D.C.,” reads one X post. And yet a check of other members reveals a diverse group. Many current and former Supreme Court justices have been members of the American Inns of Court, according to Dunn, including Sandra Day O’Connor, Neil Gorsuch, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Clarence Thomas. Inns of Court have existed in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years. The American system, founded in 1980 out of discussions among legal professionals, including Chief Justice Warren Burger, is loosely based on this concept from across the pond. The American Inns of Court stateson its websitethat it is “dedicated to professionalism, ethics, civility, and excellence” and that its mission is to “inspire the legal community to advance the rule of law by achieving the highest level of professionalism through example, education, and mentoring.” O’Connor said in a2015 videothat “maintaining and improving an ethics of professionalism is what the American Inns of Court are all about.” There are more than 300 active chapters across the U.S. Each one manages its own membership and some are limited to practitioners in a certain legal field. Roberts’ former chapter, for example,states that“members are elected to the Inn after being nominated by a current member” and that they must be “actively engaged in appellate practice.” Dunn said chapters are advised to ensure that their members include legal professionals with different levels of experience. Some may hold membership drives to recruit new faces. Roberts is currently anhonorary bencherin The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, an inn of court in the U.K. This is a purely ceremonial role that, according to Dunn. British inns of court will always offer such a position to Supreme Court justices when they are confirmed, she said. Representatives for Roberts and Boasberg did not respond to a request for comment.

Puskar)         WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. cities most vulnerable to a trade war with Canada turn out to largely be in the states that helped return Donald Trump to the White House — a sign of the possible political risk he’s taking withhis tariff plans. A new analysisreleased Thursday by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce detailed the areas most dependent on exports to Canada, with San Antonio and Detroit topping the list of 41 U.S. metro areas. The findings show that the United States’25% tariffs on Canadaand Canada’s retaliations could inflict meaningful damage in key states for U.S. politics. The analysis was conducted before the Republican president announced Wednesday that he was placingadditional 25% tariffs on imported autosand parts starting on April 3. “The consequences of today’s escalation in this destructive tariff war will not be contained to Canada, as much as the U.S. administration would like to pretend,” said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.” Nearly half of what San Antonio exports, with its aerospace, auto and energy sectors, goes to Canada. About 40% of what the auto-driven Detroit area exports also goes to Canada.Trump’s wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsinwere crucial for his overall victory in November’s presidential election — and Milwaukee and Pittsburgh also rank in the top 10 for exposure to a trade war with Canada. Other cities most dependent on exports to Canada include Kansas City, Missouri; Louisville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; Columbus, Ohio; Chicago; and Cleveland. All of those states aside from Illinois backed Trump in the last election.  Trump has placed25% tariffs on many goods from Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on energy products from Canada. Some of those tariffs have been suspended or delayed, though they’re set to fully hit in April. Canadian leaders have warnedthat the United States would suffer in the form of higher prices, fewer jobs and slower growth because of the trade war. But an analysis by the Brookings Institution found that the economic pain would be more severe in Mexico and Canada because those countries are more reliant on the United States in terms of trade. Trump’s stated reason for the tariffs is to stopillegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he’s also said that he dislikes the trade deficit with both countries and has taunted Canada by suggesting that it could becomethe 51st U.S. state.

Transgender bathroom restrictions take effect as Montana governor signs law,https://apnews.com/article/montana-transgender-bathroom-restrictions-governor-cc38040eafe556d3d90771509a150449,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Rep. Zooey Zephyr, D-Missoula, attends a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee in the Montana State Capitol in Helena, Mont. on Monday, May 1, 2023. (Thom Bridge/Independent Record via AP, File) HELENA (AP) — Transgender people in Montana can no longer use bathrooms in public buildings that do not align with their sex assigned at birth after Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signednew restrictionsinto law Thursday. The law, which takes effect with its approval, requires public buildings including the state Capitol, schools, jails, prisons, libraries and state-funded domestic violence shelters to provide separate spaces for men and women. It defines the sexes in state law based on a person’s chromosomes and reproductive biology, even as a district court ruling earlier this year declared the definitions unconstitutional. Attorneys for the ACLU of Montana filed a legal challenge to the law within hours of it being signed. They asked a state judge in Missoula to block Gianforte and Monana Attorney General Austin Knudsen from enforcing the law. The new law declares that there are only two sexes, male and female, going against ajudge’s 2024 rulingthat struck down that same definition. Under the law, transgender people cannot use public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping areas that align with their gender identity. The law does not explain how people in charge of public facilities should verify someone’s sex. Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, the Republican sponsor, said it was not meant to be exclusionary but to preserve safe spaces for women. A transgender man who has undergone a medical transition to develop more masculine features such as facial hair, muscle definition and a deeper voice is now required by law to use the women’s restroom.  Republican lawmakers swiftly approved the measure despite vocal opposition from Democrats who worried it would complicate daily life for two fellow lawmakers who are transgender and nonbinary. Among them was Rep.Zooey Zephyr, the Missoula Democrat who was silenced and sanctioned by her Republican colleagues in 2023 for comments she made on the House floor. Zephyr warned it would embolden some to police another person’s gender in public, which she said could create hostile situations for everyone. The law allows people to sue a facility for not preventing transgender people from using a certain restroom or changing room. They can recover nominal damages, generally $1, and the entity could be required to pay the plaintiff’s legal fees.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
Child complains of ‘monster’ under the bed. Babysitter then comes face-to-face with man hiding there,https://apnews.com/article/monster-under-bed-babysitter-kansas-00004624219431932311888a4ca08776,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A babysitter looked under a bed to reassure a worried child that there wasn’t a monster hiding there — and came face-to-face with a man who wasn’t supposed to be there, a sheriff’s office in Kansas said in a news release. The 27-year-old was booked into jail this week after a struggle with the babysitter that knocked the child to the ground. The Barton County Sheriff’s Office said deputies were called late Monday to the home near Great Bend, a city of around 15,000 in the western part of the state. The suspect was gone when they arrived, but the babysitter told them that the child had been complaining about a “monster” before she found the suspect. The man once lived in the home, but that there was a protection from abuse order issued against him to stay away from the property, the sheriff’s office said. Deputies searched but were unable to find the man until the next day, when he was captured after a foot chase, the news release said. Online court records show the man had posted bond about 10 days earlier after he was charged with criminal threat, domestic battery and violating a protection from abuse order. Those allegations were alleged to have occurred in January and February. But following his latest arrest, a judge ordered him jailed without bond. The sheriff’s office said additional requested charges include aggravated burglary, aggravated battery and child endangerment.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
