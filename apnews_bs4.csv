No timetable from Texas governor on filling late Democratic congressman’s vacant seat,https://apnews.com/article/sylvester-turner-congress-democrats-d3c5565aad5c9c2f0d3bafdcb47977dd,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Greg Abbott speaks with reporters after President Donald Trump spoke at an education event and executive order signing in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The race to fill a Texas congressional seat has candidates but no election date more than three weeks afterRep. Sylvester Turner’s deathleft a vacancy in a stronghold for Democrats, who are eager to cut into Republicans’narrow U.S. House majority. Turner, a former Houston mayor, died March 5 just weeks into his first term in Congress. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has the sole authority to call a special election but has not said when he might do so, drawing criticism from some Democrats who have accused him of trying to help protect the GOP’s margins. The seat is one of four vacancies in Congress, including two in Florida, wherevoters next weekwill choose successors in special elections for a pair of GOP-held districts. Republicans currently hold 218 seats, while Democrats hold 213 seats. “An announcement on a special election will be made at a later date,” Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said in an email, in response to whether the House majority is factoring into the governor’s decision-making. Elections in Texas are typically held in May and November. In 2021, Abbott called for a special election two weeks after RepublicanRep. Ron Wrightbecame the first member of Congress to die after contracting COVID-19 during the pandemic. Last year, Abbott called a special election for the vacant seat ofDemocratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Leeabout two weeks after her death in July. “This is very clearly playing political games. They know the U.S. majority in the House is on razor-thin margins,” said Democratic state Rep. Gene Wu of Houston, leader of the state House Democratic Caucus.  On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that he waspulling Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nominationto the United Nations over concerns that it could threaten Republicans’ tight majority in the House, posting on his Truth Social platform that it was “essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress.” Trump’s announcement reflects a growing concern among GOP members in the House who are fearful that their already threadbare majority will narrow and jeopardize their control of the chamber and ability to carry out Trump’s sweeping agenda. New York Democrats had introduced legislation that would have delayed the special election and allowed Stefanik’s seat to remain open for several months but put the measure on ice after intense pushback from Republicans. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and former Houston City Council Member Amanda Edwards are two of the top candidates vying for the Texas seat. Menefee quickly acquired endorsements from former Democratic Reps. Colin Allred and Beto O’Rourke. Edwards, an attorney, ran for the seat twice last year. In Arizona, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs called for a special election days afterRep. Raul Grijalvadied on March 13. Associated Press writer Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York, contributed to this report.

No need to apply: Cal State is automatically admitting high school students with good grades,https://apnews.com/us-news/colleges-and-universities-schools-napa-riverside-san-bernardino-04ec5a0763b3f69d621893ea699931fa,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. More than 17,400 high school seniors last fall got the sweetest news any anxious student can get: Congratulations, because of your high school GPA, you’re automatically admitted to one of 10 California State University campuses of your choice — and they’re all relatively affordable. Even with less than a week to go before the campuses wrap their final decisions about whom to admit,a pilot program focusing on Riverside Countyis already showing that more students have been admitted from the county than last year, about 10,600 so far in 2025 compared to last year’s roughly 9,800. The pilot builds on Cal State’s efforts to enroll more students and works like this: High school seniors receive a notice in the mail that they’re automatically admitted as long as they maintain their grades, finish the 15 mandatory courses necessary for admission to a Cal State, and complete an admissions form to claim their spot at a campus. Cal State was able to mail the notices because it signed an agreement with the Riverside County Office of Education that gave the university eligible students’ addresses. Now in the program’s first year, Cal State joins other public universities across the country in a growing national movement toautomatically admit eligible students. From November through January, Cal State informed students they were accepted to the 10 campuses. To claim a spot, students needed to go online and pick at least one campus. If past admissions and enrollment trends hold, Cal State as a system will educate hundreds of more students, all from Riverside, than they would have without the pilot. That’d be a boon for a system that prides itself on its affordability and motto that it’s the people’s university; Cal State admits a far higher percentage of students than the University of California. It also could serve as a much-needed budget boost from the extra tuition revenue those students bring, especially at campuses with sinking enrollment. Eight campuses — Channel Islands, Chico, East Bay, Humboldt, Maritime Academy, Monterey Bay, San Francisco, and Sonoma — are so under-enrolled that Cal State is pulling some of their state revenues to sendto campuses that are still growing. Cal Maritime is soon merging with another campusbecause of its perilous finances. The pilot also includes the two closest campuses to the county, San Bernardino and San Marcos. The system chose Riverside County because all of its public high school students were already loaded onto a state data platform thatcan directly transmit student grades to Cal State— a key step in creating automatic admissions. Riverside is also “ethnically and economically representative of the diversity of California — many of the students the CSU is so proud to serve,” a spokesperson for the system, Amy Bentley Smith, wrote in an email. At Heritage High School, a public school in Riverside County, the pilot encouraged students who previously didn’t even consider attending a public four-year university to submit the automatic admission forms to a Cal State.  Silvia Morales, a 17-year-old senior at Heritage, got an automatic admissions letter. “I was pretty set on going to community college and then transferring, because I felt like I wasn’t ready for the four-year commitment to a college,” she said. Even with a 3.0 GPA, higher thanthe 2.5 GPA Cal State requires for admission, she nearly didn’t submit the forms to secure her admission until early January. That’s well past the standard Nov. 30 admissions deadline. It wasn’t until her counselor, Chris Tinajero, pulled her into a meeting that she decided to opt into the pilot. “I went through the sales pitch like, ‘Hey, you get this guaranteed admission, you’re an amazing student,’” he recounted. The pitch worked. Though Cal State sent a physical pamphlet and her high school also emailed her about the pilot, “I wasn’t really paying attention,” Morales said. She needed an adult she trusted at the school to persuade her that the applications were worth the effort, she said. Morales applied to three Cal State campuses in the pilot plus two outside the program that were still accepting late applications — Chico, Humboldt, Los Angeles, Northridge and San Bernardino. She got into each one, she said. Her parents are “proud of me because I want to go to college,” Morales said. Neither went to college, she added. Final enrollment figures won’t be tallied until August, including how many of the students admitted through the pilot attended one of the 10 campuses. But the system’s chancellor’s office is already planning to replicate the pilot program in a Northern California county, which will be named sometime in April, Cal State officials said. Abillby Christopher Cabaldon, a state senator and Democrat from Napa, would make automatic enrollment to Cal State for eligible students a state law. The bill hasn’t been heard in a committee yet. Of the 17,000 students who received an invitation to secure their automatic admissions, about 13,200 submitted the necessary forms. That’s about 3,000 more students who applied from the county than last year. Those who otherwise wouldn’t have applied to a Cal State include students who were eyeing private colleges, said Melina Gonzalez, a counselor at Heritage who typically advises students who are already college-bound. Nearby private colleges offer all students application fee waivers; at Cal State, typically only low-income students receive fee waivers. But the pilot provided each Cal State student one fee waiver worth $70, which was a draw to students and their parents who don’t qualify for the fee waiver but might struggle to pay. Last year, 10 of the 100 senior students Gonzalez counseled didn’t apply to a Cal State. This application season, all her students submitted at least one Cal State application, she said. “It was big, it was really cool, their eyes, they were so excited,” she said of the automatically admitted students. “They would come in and show me their letters.” Parents called her asking if the pamphlet from Cal State was authentic. With guaranteed admission, some parents ultimately decided to pay for additional applications to campuses in the pilot, knowing it wasn’t in vain. At Heritage, high school counselors reviewed Cal State’s provisional list of students eligible for the pilot to add more seniors, such as those who hadn’t yet completed the mandatory courses but were on track to do so. Tinajero was also able to persuade some students who hadn’t completed all the required courses for Cal State entry to take those, including online classes. Still, others with qualifying grades didn’t apply because they weren’t persuaded that a four-year university was for them. Tinajero sees program growth in the coming years, assuming Cal State continues with the pilot. Younger high school students who witnessed the fanfare of automatic admissions may take more seriously the need to pass the 15 required courses to be eligible for a Cal State or University of California campus, he said. That’s part of Cal State’s vision for this pilot, said April Grommo, the system’s assistant vice chancellor of strategic enrollment management: Begin encouraging students to take the required courses in ninth grade so that by 11th and 12th grade they’re more receptive to applying to Cal State. The automatic admissions pilot is likely what explains the jump in overall applicants, said Grommo. “If you look at the historical numbers of Riverside County students that have applied to the CSU, it’s very consistent at 10,000, so there’s no other accelerator or explanation for the significant increase in the applications,” she said. Some campuses in the pilot are probably going to see more students from Riverside County than others. The eight under-enrolled Cal State campuses each enrolled fewer than than 100 Riverside students as freshmen, a CalMatters review of 2024 admissions data show. Two enrolled fewer than 10 Riverside students as freshmen. Cal State isn’t solely relying on past trends to enroll more students. Grommo cited research that suggests direct admissions programs are associated with increases in student enrollment, but not among low-income students, who are less familiar with the college-going process or have additional economic and family demands, like work and child care. Even after students are admitted, some don’t complete key steps in the enrollment process, such as maintaining their grades in the second semester, completing registration forms to enroll, and paying deposits. Others, especially low-income students, have a change of heart over summer about attending college,which scholars call “summer melt.” Then there are the students who got into typically more selective campuses, such as at elite private schools and the University of California, and choose instead to go to those. To prompt more students to actually enroll, Cal State officials in early March hostedtwo college fairsin Riverside County for students admitted through the pilot. About 2,600 students signed up to be bussed from their high schools to large venues, including the Riverside Convention Center, where they met with staff, alumni and current students from all 10 Cal State campuses participating in the program. Those were followed by receptions with students and parents. Grommo said they maxed out capacity at both venues for the student events. While it’s common for individual campuses to host events for admitted students, it was a first for Cal State’s central office. The event costs, physical mailers to students about their admissions guarantee, invitation to the college fairs and another flyer about the relative affordability of a Cal State cost the system’s central office around $300,000, Grommo estimates. But if the event moves the needle on students agreeing to attend a Cal State, the tuition revenue at the largely under-enrolled campuses alone would be a huge return on investment. The effort is a far more targeted approach than another admissions outreach effort Cal State rolled out last fall to inform students who started but didn’t finish their college applications that they’re provisionally accepted, as long as they complete and send their forms. The notification went to 106,000 students and was the result of a$750,000 grant Cal State won from the Lumina Foundation, a major higher education philanthropy. The system will know by fall if this notification resulted in more students attending a Cal State. But that was aimed at students who already applied. The Riverside pilot brings in students, like Morales, who wouldn’t have applied without the mailers and entreaties from counselors. She’s leaning toward picking Cal State San Bernardino for next fall. It’s close to home and an older cousin recently graduated who had a good experience there, she said. Her next task? Working with her parents to complete the federal application for financial aid by April 2, the deadline for guaranteed tuition waivers for low- and middle-income students. It’s possible that Cal State may take the direct admissions pilot statewide. All counties are required by state law to join the state-funded data system that Riverside is already a part of to electronically transmit students’ high school grades to Cal States and UCs. Doing so removes the need for schools to send campuses paper transcripts. The deadline for all counties to join the state data system is summer of 2026.

Utah becomes first state to ban LGBTQ+ pride flags in government buildings and schools,https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-pride-flag-ban-utah-school-republican-ced0db22bd0ce8d37e010e9a65fec220,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. People march following a Pride rally at the Utah State Capitol Friday, June 2, 2023, in Salt Lake City. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah became the first state to prohibit flyingLGBTQ+pride flags at schools and all government buildings after the Republican governor announced he was allowing a ban on unsanctioned flag displays to become law without his signature. Gov. Spencer Cox, who made the announcement late Thursday night, said he continues to have serious concerns with the policy but chose not to reject it because his veto would likely be overridden by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Starting May 7, state or local government buildings will be fined $500 a day for flying any flag other than the United States flag, the Utah state flag, military flags or a short list of others approved by lawmakers. Political flags supporting a certain candidate or party, such as President Donald Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” flags, are not allowed. The new law could stoke conflict between the state and its largest city. City buildings in liberal Salt Lake City typically honor Pride Month each June by displaying flags that celebrate its large LGBTQ+ population. Local leaders have illuminated the Salt Lake City and County Building in rainbow lights to protest the flag ban each night since the Legislature sent it to Cox’s desk. Andrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s office, said their attorneys are evaluating the law and the capital city does not yet have information on what it will do once the law takes effect.  The bill’s Republican sponsors, Rep. Trevor Lee and Sen. Dan McCay, said it’s meant to encourage “political neutrality” from teachers and other government employees. Opponents argued it aims to erase LGBTQ+ expression and take authority away from cities and towns that don’t align politically with the Republican Legislature. In a letter to legislative leaders explaining his decision, Cox said he agreed with the “underlying intent” of the bill to make classrooms politically neutral but thought it went too far in regulating local governments. He also noted that by focusing narrowly on flags, the law does not prevent other political displays such as posters or lighting. “To our LGBTQ community, I know that recent legislation has been difficult,” Cox said. “Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we’ve had our disagreements. I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.” Cox’s decision came hours after theSundance Film Festivalannounced it wasleaving its homeof four decades inPark City, Utah, forBoulder, Colorado. The flag bill created eleventh-hour tensions as some residents worried it would push the nation’s premier independent film festival out of state. Festival leaders said state politics ultimately did not influence their move from conservative Utah to liberal Colorado. They did, however, make “ethos and equity values” one of their criteria in a nationwide search for a new home and referred to Boulder in their announcement as a “welcoming environment.” Utah’s flag law goes further than one signed last week in Idaho that only applies to schools. But Idaho Republicans are also advancing a separate bill to ban government buildings from displaying certain flags. Florida lawmakers have advanced a proposal to ban pride flags and others that represent political viewpoints in schools and public buildings after similar measures failed in the past two legislative sessions. Some federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, also have limited which flags can fly at their facilities. Other flags permitted under the Utah law include Olympic and Paralympic flags, official college or university flags, tribal flags and historic versions of other approved flags that might be used for educational purposes.

Haitian ex-mayor found guilty of lying about rights abuses to get US residency,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-mayor-human-rights-abuse-visa-9e2fe4c76f9fb6a8f90dc8fe173112db,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BOSTON (AP) — Aformer mayor from Haitiwas found guilty on Friday for lying on his visa application about a series of politically motivated attacks against his opponents that left one dead and several people injured. Jean Morose Viliena, who has been living just north of Boston in the city of Malden, Massachusetts, was indicted in 2023 on three counts of visa fraud. Authorities say he wrote on his application that he had not “ordered, carried out or materially assisted in extrajudicial and political killings and other acts of violence against the Haitian people.” Federal prosecutors said that while Viliena was mayor of the town of Les Irois — an isolated, rural community of about 22,000 on Haiti’s western tip — he committed “violent atrocities” against his political foes. The impoverished community is only accessible by a dirt road that winds through the mountains. He faces a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. In 2007, prosecutors said, Viliena led a group of his allies to the home of a political opponent, where he and his associates shot and killed the opponent’s younger brother, then smashed his skull with a rock. Prosecutors also allege that in 2008, Viliena and his allies went armed with guns, machetes, picks and sledgehammers to shut down a community radio station that he opposed. Authorities said he pistol-whipped and punched a man and ordered an associate to shoot and kill the man and another person.  Both survived, but one of the men lost a leg and the other was blinded in one eye. Defense attorneys argued in court that it was members of a rival political party — including some who they say are government witnesses — who committed the violence detailed in the charges against Viliena. They described the former mayor as the son of a farmer who became a teacher and eventually ran for mayor to improve conditions in town. In 2023, Viliena wasfound liable by an American jury in a civil trialin connection with the killing and the two attempted killings and assessed $15.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.

"Voice of America wins in court, for now, as judge blocks Trump administration from firing staff",https://apnews.com/article/voice-of-america-trump-a1ed0ad37917055a1565da5325bd4fd8,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The Voice of America building, Monday, June 15, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The Voice of America can’t be silenced just yet. A federal judge on Friday halted the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service, calling the move a “classic case of arbitrary and capricious decision making.” Judge James Paul Oetken blocked the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which runs Voice of America, from firing more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff that it sidelined two weeks ago in the wake of President Donald Trump ordering its funding slashed. Oetken issued a temporary restraining order barring the agency from “any further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough” employees or contractors, and from closing any offices or requiring overseas employees to return to the U.S. The order also bars the Agency for Global Media from terminating grant funding for its other broadcast outlets, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Afghanistan. The agency said Thursday it was restoring Radio Free Europe’s funding after a judge in Washington, D.C. ordered it to do so. “This is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke” to the Trump administration’s “utter disregard for the principles that define our democracy,” said the plaintiffs’ lawyer Andrew G. Celli Jr.  At a hearing Friday in Manhattan, Oetken faulted the Trump administration for “taking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorized and funded by Congress.” The judge criticized the agency’s leadership, including special adviser Kari Lake, for pulling the plug “seemingly overnight” on the U.S. government’s global, soft-power megaphone with “no consideration of the effects.” Oetken ruled after a coalition of Voice of America journalists, labor unions and the nonprofit journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders sued the Trump administration last week to block the cuts. Ultimately, they seek to have VOA return to the air. The plaintiffs argued the shutdown violated a court’s finding during Trump’s first term that VOA journalists have a free-speech firewall protecting them from White House interference. Their absence from the airwaves has left a vacuum that’s being filled by “propagandists whose messages will monopolize global airwaves,” the plaintiffs said. Trump and other Republicans have accused Voice of America of a “leftist bias” and failing to project “pro-American” values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by congress to serve as a non-partisan news organization. Voice of America went off the air soon after Trump issued an executive order on March 14 that pared funding to the Agency for Global Media and six other unrelated federal entities — part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda. It also moved this month toterminate VOA contracts with news agencies,including The Associated Press. The White House called the service “The Voice of Radical America” and said Trump’s order would “ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.” It cited coverage it said was “too favorable” to former President Joe Biden, as well as stories about white privilege, racial profiling and transgender migrants seeking asylum. Congress has appropriated nearly $860 million for the Agency for Global Media for the current fiscal year. Three federal lawsuits in Washington, D.C. are challenging other aspects of the cuts, including one brought by Voice of America’s director and three journalists. Oetken said he’ll rule at a later date on the government’s request to move his case there. Voice of America has operated since World War II,beaming news into authoritarian countries that don’t have a free press. It began as a counterpoint to Nazi propaganda and played a prominent role in the U.S. government’s Cold War efforts to curb the spread of communism. According to the lawsuit, Voice of America employees were told to finish their live broadcasts on March 15, then vacate the building. Soon after, the lawsuit said, they lost access to agency computer systems, including email. Voice of America’s news website hasn’t been updated since. Lake, a former TV news anchor and political candidate, said she has been determining how many people are required to operate some of these outlets at the minimum staffing levels allowed by law. Some people have been brought back to work and at least one service — Radio Marti in Cuba — has returned to the air, Lake told One America News Network in an interview posted Thursday on X. “We’re going to get lawsuits,” Lake said. “This is just par for the course. We’ve been victims — President Trump has, I myself have — of ‘lawfare’. It’s the same cast of characters that is trying to put landmines in the ways of every step President Trump and this administration is trying to do to get this government back in line to where we can actually afford it.” Lake, echoing the White House’s complaints, said: “We want to make sure that these agencies are in line with what our American values are. We’re telling America’s story. We’re not telling our adversaries’ stories.” “By God,” she said, “we’re not going to be putting out anti-American garbage.” Associated Press media writer David Bauder contributed to this report.

Millions of Syrians, like Al-Ahmad and her family, can’t afford to pay hefty fees for private generator services or install solar panels. Syria’s new authorities underinterim leader Ahmad Al-Sharaahave tried to ease the country’s electricity crisis, but have been unable to stop the outages with patchwork solutions. Even with a recent gas deal with Qatar and an agreement with Kurdish-led authorities that will give them access to Syria’s oil fields, the country spends most of its days with virtually no power. Reports of oil shipments coming from Russia, a key military and political ally of Assad, shows the desperation.

It’s just enough that her children can huddle in the living room to finish their homework after school. And the family is not alone.

But the new interim authorities have scrambled to establish control across the country and convince Western nations to lift economic sanctions to make its economy viable again. The United States in Januaryeased some restrictionsfor six months, authorizing some energy-related transactions. But it doesn’t appear to have made a significant difference on the ground just yet. Washington and other Western governments face a delicate balance with Syria’s new authorities, and appear to be keen on lifting restrictions only if the war-torn country’s political transition is democratic and inclusive of Syrian civil society, women and non-Sunni Muslim communities. Some minority groups have been concerned about the new authorities, especially incidents of revenge attacks targeting the Alawite community during acounter-offensiveagainst an insurgency of Assad loyalists. Fixing Syria’s damaged power plants and oil fields takes time, so Damascus is racing to get as much fuel as it can to produce more energy.

(AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad)  Damascus is now looking towards the northeastern provinces, where its oil fields under Kurdish-led authorities are to boost its capacity, especially afterreaching a landmark ceasefire dealwith them. Political economist Karam Shaar said 85% of the country’s oil production is based in those areas, and Syria once exported crude oil in exchange for refined oil to boost local production, though the fields are battered and bruised from years of conflict. These crucial oil fields fell into the hands of the extremist Islamic State group, which carved out a so-called caliphate across large swaths of Syria and Iraq from 2014 to 2017. “It’s during that period where much of the damage to the (oil) sector happened,” said Shaar, highlighting intense airstrikes and fighting against the group by a U.S.-led international coalition.

The new authorities hope to resolve this in a landmark deal with the SDF signed earlier this month. Kamran Omar, who oversees oil production in the Rmeilan oil fields in the northeastern city of Hassakeh, says shortages in equipment and supplies and clashes that persisted with Turkey and Turkish-backed forces have slowed down production, but told the AP that some of that production will eventually go to households and factories in other parts of Syria. The fields only produce a fraction of what they once did. The Rmeilan field sends just 15,000 of the approximately 100,000 barrels they produce to other parts of Syria to ease some of the burden on the state. The authorities in Damascus also hope that a recent deal with Qatar that would supply them with gas through Jordan to a major plant south of the capital will be the first of more agreements.

Moscow once aided Assad in the conflict against armed Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that toppled the former president, but this shows that they are willing to stock up on fuel from whoever is offering. Interim Electricity Minister Omar Shaqrouq admitted in a news conference that bringing back electricity to Syrian homes 24 hours a day is not on the horizon. “It will soon be four hours, but maybe some more in the coming days.” Smoke rises from a tank used as makeshift refinery on the outskirts of Qamishli, northeast Syria, Saturday, March 22, 2025, where oil is refined into gasoline and other products like diesel.

(AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad)  Increasing that supply will be critical for the battered country, which hopes to ease the economic woes of millions and bring about calm and stability. Shaar, who has visited and met with Syria’s new authorities, says that the focus on trying to bring fuel in the absence of funding for major infrastructural overhauls is the best Damascus can do given how critical the situation is. “Electricity is the cornerstone of economic recovery,” said Shaar. “Without electricity you can’t have a productive sector, (or any) meaningful industries.” Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

(AP Photo/Allison Joyce, File) In North Carolina, wildfires stoked by unusually dry air and debris from last year’s Hurricane Helene are burning out of control. In Florida, there are dozens of blazes, including one that scorched about 42 square miles in Miami-Dade County. And they continue to burn in Oklahoma, where four people have died this month due to wind-driven fires. Those states were just three of eight where large fires were being reported on Friday. Some 14,800 wildfires have burned 1,105 square miles so far this year — well above the 10-year average, according to data released Friday by theNational Interagency Fire Center. Most devastating were theLos Angeleswildfires in January, fueled by dry vegetation and howling winds, that destroyed entire neighborhoods. Wildfires have happened with such frequency in recent years that many U.S. fire officials say there is no longer a “fire season,” which traditionally ran from late spring through the fall. That is because climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, has raised average global temperatures, creating drier conditions that allow wildfires, which are mostly mostly caused by humans, to burn longer and more intensely.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams, File)  While major fires often happen early in the year — in February 2024, Texas experienced thelargest wildfirein state history — this year is a bit unusual “because we’re seeing it happen in so many places,” said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist who monitors drought. This week, 45% of the country is in drought, when historically it’s around 20% at any given time, Rippey said. That dried out lots of fuel just waiting for a spark — from freeze-dried grasses in the southern Plains to downed trees and brush from hurricanes that ravaged parts of the southeast and southern Appalachians in recent years.  The National Interagency Fire Center’s significant wildfire outlook notes that several states still have debris from hurricanes Laura, Ida, Debby and Idalia in the past five years, as well as from ice storms and other severe weather. Add in gusty winds and low humidity, “and you’ve got a pretty ripe situation for wildfires,” Rippey said. Smoke rise from the Black Cove Fire, March 26, 2025, in Saluda, N.C. (AP Photo/Allison Joyce, File)  In Hurricane Helene-devastatedNorth Carolina,power lines downed by strong winds have been blamed for two of three large fires that have burned for more than a week in an area where the mean relative humidity this month has been the lowest on record, officials said. Impassable areas and lots of toppled trees are making it difficult to reach intense and erratic fires that are spreading rapidly because of high winds and dry weather. Many roads have either been covered with storm debris or “they have just been completely washed away,” said North Carolina Forest Service spokesman Philip Jackson, who said the fire danger could plague the state for years as more debris dries out. Much of Florida also is in drought, contributing to an earlier-than-normal fire season that included a massive brush fire in Miami-Dade County that at one point hindered travel to and from the Florida Keys. That fire is 95% contained while dozens of smaller fires continue to burn, according to the Florida Forest Service. Many counties are under red flag warnings, meaning conditions are favorable for fires to occur. The Black Cove Fire burns, March 26, 2025, in Saluda, N.C. (AP Photo/Allison Joyce, File)  West Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Missouri and South Carolina also report large wildfires. The greatest wildfire potential is in the southeast and the southern Plains, and will be significant into April in most of Texas and parts of New Mexico and Arizona, as well as several southeastern states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. La Nina — a periodic cooling of the Pacific Ocean that can shift the jet stream and lead to cooler, drier air — might have affected conditions in the southern U.S., said Tim Brown, director of the Western Regional Climate Center. But there also has been long-term drying in the southwest as temperatures overall increase with global warming, said Rippey, who has monitored drought for more than 25 years. Warmer temperatures have led to more erratic precipitation that tends to fall more heavily in short periods, leading much of it to run off rather than soak into the ground. “I do think that contributes to more wildfires,” he said.

Canadian company seeks US permission to start deep-sea mining as outcry ensues,https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-deep-sea-mining-isa-d24270d1674ce93035adc1e0be511725,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Delegates from across the world gather for a meeting by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a U.N. body in Kingston, Jamaica, July 14, 2015. (AP Photo/David McFadden, File) SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — An abrupt announcement rattled members of a little-known U.N. agency based in Jamaica that has protected international deep-sea waters for more than 30 years. The Metals Company in Vancouver, Canada said late Thursday that it is seeking permission from the U.S. government to startdeep-sea miningin international waters, potentially bypassing the International Seabed Authority, which has the power to authorize exploitation permits buthas yet to do so. “It would be a major breach of international law…if the U.S. were to grant it,” said Duncan Currie, an international and environmental lawyer and legal adviser to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a Netherlands-based alliance of environmental groups. The Metals Company seeks seafloor minerals like cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese used in electric car batteries and other green technology. The announcement was made just hours before the 36-member council of the International Seabed Authority met in Jamaica on Friday, the last day of a two-week conference focused on how and if to allow deep-sea mining,a years-long debate. The authority was scheduled to talk Friday about the company’s commercial mining application. “The scale of the threat…has been taken incredibly seriously here,” said Louisa Casson, a campaigner at Greenpeace who attended Friday’s meeting. “There are questions and a lack of clarity of what they actually plan on doing.”  She said one question is whether the company plans to request a permit anyway from the authority even as it continues talks with the U.S. government. Currie said the timing of The Metals Company’s announcement was “insulting to the ISA.” “It’s an extremely irresponsible threat. It’s basically holding a gun to the international community,” he said. The International Seabed Authority was created in 1994 by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is ratified by more than 165 nations — but not the United States. The Metals Company argued that the United States’ seabed mining code would allow it to start operations in international waters since it’s not a member of the authority and therefore not bound by its rules. The company said it was already in discussions with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others. “We have met with numerous officials in the White House as well as U.S. Congress regarding their support for this industry,” the company said in a statement. NOAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Metals Company criticized what it said was “slow progress” by the International Seabed Authority on a proposed mining code that has yet to be finalized. The authority has issued more than 30 exploration licenses but no provisional licenses. Most of the current exploration is happening in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone, which covers 1.7 million square miles (4.5 million square kilometers) between Hawaii and Mexico. It is occurring at depths ranging from 13,000 to 19,000 feet (4,000 to 6,000 meters). More than 30 countries including Canada have called for a ban, pause or moratorium on deep-sea mining, and companies including Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen, Google and Samsung have pledged not to use seafloor minerals. “The international seabed is the common heritage of humankind, and no state should take unilateral action to exploit it,” Greenpeace said in a statement. Scientists have warnedthat minerals in the ocean’s bowels take millions of years to form, and that mining could unleash noise, light and suffocating dust storms. “The deep ocean is one of the last truly wild places on Earth, home to life we’re only beginning to understand. Letting deep-sea mining go forward now would be like starting a fire in a library of books nobody’s even read yet,” said Emily Jeffers, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. However, companies have argued that deep-sea mining is cheaper and has less of an impact than land mining.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Trump claimed there has been a “concerted and widespread” effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing “objective facts” with a “distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,” adding that it casts the “founding principles” of the United States in a “negative light.”  The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice PresidentJD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution’s Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to “remove improper ideology” from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.

Travers, Feb. 10, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)   It marks the Republican president’s latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently hadhimself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Artswith the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recentlyforced Columbia University to make a series of policy changesby threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.  The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing ofGeorge Floydin Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.   The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the250th anniversaryof the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  Trump singled out theNational Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women’s History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.  “Museums in our Nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,” he said.  Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution’s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, “We have no comment for now.”  Under Trump’s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn’t spent on programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.” Trump also wants to ensure that the women’s history museum celebrates women and not “recognize men as women in any respect.”  It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to “perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.”  The Smithsonian Institution is the world’s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.  The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found “at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

US Naval Academy ends affirmative action in admissions,https://apnews.com/article/naval-academy-ends-affirmative-action-c3da564f7ac60dbde772f1b0499d5d1c,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. An entrance to the U.S. Naval Academy campus in Annapolis, Md., is seen Jan. 9, 2014. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — The U.S. Naval Academy will no longer consider race, ethnicity or sex as a factor for admission to the service institution, a response to an executive order by President Donald Trump, according to federal court documents made public Friday. The change in policy was made in February by Vice Adm. Yvette Davids, the academy’s superintendent, in response to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January, according to a court filing by the U.S. Justice Department in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The president’s order on Jan. 27 said that “every element of the Armed Forces should operate free from any preference based on race or sex.” It also directed the secretary of defense to conduct an internal review with respect to all “activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system,” including reviews at the service academies. “Under revised internal guidance issued by the Superintendent on Feb. 14, 2025, neither race, ethnicity, nor sex can be considered as a factor for admission at any point during the admissions process, including qualification and acceptance,” according to the court filing made public Friday. The decision comes after a federal judgeruled in Decemberthat the academy could continue considering race in its admissions process. In that case, the judge found that military cohesion and other national security factors mean the school should not be subjected to the same standards as civilian universities.  During a two-week bench trial in September, attorneys for the academy argued that prioritizing diversity in the military makes it stronger, more effective and more widely respected. The case against the policy was brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions, which was appealing the judge’s decision. The Justice Department asked in the filing on Friday to suspend the current briefing schedule in the case while the parties consider the change in the academy’s policy. ‘The parties require a reasonable amount of time to discuss the details of the Academy’s new policy and to consider the appropriate next steps for this litigation, including whether this litigation is now moot and, if so, whether the district court judgment should be vacated,” the Justice Department wrote. Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, praised the academy’s decision. “Students for Fair Admissions welcomes the announcement that the U.S. Naval Academy will end its unfair and illegal race-based admissions policies. Racial discrimination is wrong and racial classifications have no place at our nation’s military academies,” Blum said in a statement. Maryland Rep. Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat who serves on the academy’s Board of Visitors, criticized the change, saying “this disastrous decision will have negative implications on our military’s recruitment and retention for decades to come.” “A Navy and Marine Corps that reflect the diversity of our country is our strongest Navy and Marine Corps,” Elfreth said. “Diversity and inclusion allow our academies to not just reflect how our country looks but are critical to mission readiness and strong national security.” Students for Fair Admissions also brought the lawsuit challenging affirmative action that resulted in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023. The high court’s conservative majority broadly prohibited the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions, ending a long-standing practice meant to boost opportunities for historically marginalized groups and sending shock waves through higher education. But it carved out a potential exemption for military academies, suggesting that national security interests could affect the legal analysis. Students for Fair Admissions later sued the Annapolis-based Naval Academy, challenging the exemption. But Judge Richard Bennett rejected their arguments, saying that the school had “established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps.” Attorneys for the group argued during trial that prioritizing minority candidates is unfair to qualified white applicants and that cohesion should arise from other sources such as training and command structure. The academy argued in that case that its admissions process considers many factors, including grades, extracurricular activities, life experience and socioeconomic status, according to court testimony. Race often played no role in the process, but sometimes it came under consideration in a “limited fashion,” attorneys for the academy wrote in court papers.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Appeals court rules Trump can fire board members of independent labor agencies,https://apnews.com/article/trump-labor-boards-appeals-court-f6b238e0937857b950a5a87c98634383,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON (AP) — An appeals courtruled FridaythatPresident Donald Trumpcan fire two board members of independent agencies handling labor issues from their respective posts in the federal government. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed to lift orders blocking the Trump administration from removing Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris and National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox. On March 4, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Trump illegally tried to fire Harris. Two days later, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled that Trump did not have the authority to remove Wilcox. The Justice Department asked the appellate court to suspend those orders while they appeal the decisions. President Joe Biden nominated Harris to the MSPB in 2021 and nominated Wilcox to a second five-year term as an NLRB member in 2023. Circuit Judge Justin Walker, a Trump nominee, said the administration likely will succeed in showing that the statutory removal protections for NLRB and MSPB members are unconstitutional. “The Government has also shown that it will suffer irreparable harm each day the President is deprived of the ability to control the executive branch,” Walker wrote. Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush, wrote an opinion concurring with Walker. Henderson said she agrees with Walker on many of the “general principles” about the contours of presidential power under the Constitution.  Judge Patricia Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, wrote a dissenting opinion. She said her two colleagues on the case “rewrite controlling Supreme Court precedent and ignore binding rulings of this court, all in favor of putting this court in direct conflict with at least two other circuits.” “The stay decision also marks the first time in history that a court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, has licensed the termination of members of multimember adjudicatory boards statutorily protected by the very type of removal restriction the Supreme Court has twice unanimously upheld,” Millett wrote. Government lawyers argued that Trump had the authority to remove both board members. InWilcox’s case, they said Howell’s “unprecedented order works a grave harm to the separation of powers and undermines the President’s ability to exercise his authority under the Constitution.” Theyalso arguedthat MSPB members like Harris are removable “at will” by the president. Wilcox’s attorneys saidTrump couldn’t fire her without notice, a hearing or identifying any “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office” on her part. They argued that the administration’s “only path to victory” is to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to “adopt a more expansive view of presidential power.” Harris’ attorneys claimed the administration was asking the appeals court to ignore Supreme Court precedent. “Make no mistake: The government’s radical theory would upend the law,”they wrote. “It would jeopardize not only this board, but also the Federal Reserve Board and other critical entities, like the Securities and Exchange Commission.” The five-member NLRB lacked a quorum after Wilcox’s removal. The three-member MSPB enforces civil rights law in the workplace.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Trevor Wilson/U.S. Army via AP)                             WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. and Lithuanian troops and authorities are struggling to drain a swampy area in Lithuania in an ongoing effort to recover four American Army soldiers who went missing three days ago. The soldiers’ armored vehicle was discovered submerged in 15 feet of water and so far teams have been unable to get inside or pull it out. U.S. Army Europe and Africa said Friday that cranes, a large-capacity pump and more than 30 tons of gravel have been brought in to help drain the water, dig out the mud and pull the M88 Hercules out of the swamp. They warn that this will be a long operation. In a statement, the Army said that the area around the site is “incredibly wet and marshy and doesn’t support the weight of the equipment needed for the recovery of the 70-ton vehicle without significant engineering improvements. Draining the area has been slow and difficult due to ground water seepage.” The four soldiers, whose identities have not been released, went missing early on Tuesday when they were on a mission to recover another Army vehicle during unit training. The Hercules was found on Wednesday, and teams have been working since then to get the vehicle out. The soldiers are part of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. A U.S. Navy dive crew is being brought in, and the Polish Armed Forces have volunteered to send engineers, additional equipment and 150 personnel to also assist.  “This will be a long and difficult recovery operation, but we are absolutely committed to bringing our soldiers home,” said Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, commander of 1st Armored Division. “I remain incredibly impressed by the discipline, commitment and comradery in this unit as they attempt to recover their missing comrades.” The soldiers were reported missing during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town less than 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border with Belarus.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                               LOS ANGELES (AP) — When filmmaker Travis Gutiérrez Senger reflects on ASCO’s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence onChicano art history. “That movement continues today, and it’s very expansive,” he says. “There’s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.” He’s referring to “ASCO: Without Permission,” a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herrón III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group “asco” — “nausea” or “disgust” in Spanish — after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles. All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way. “To behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,” said executive producer Gael García Bernal at the film’sSouth by Southwest film festivalpremiere earlier this month. “You’re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.”  Bernal and Diego Lunaexecutive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution. Patssi Valdez, a founding member of the Chicano art collective ASCO (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Gutiérrez Senger’s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO’s early rebellion. “I felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,” said Gamboa. Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding. “For the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn’t happened before,” she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators. ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid theEast LA walkouts, protesting education inequality,and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality. Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities. “The response to such violence was to create art,” said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints. For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet. “I couldn’t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,” said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled “Instant Mural,” a metaphor on feeling captive. One of ASCO’s most known works is “Spray Paint LACMA.” Gamboa, Gronk and Herrón spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, “Chicanos are in gangs, they don’t make art.” Harry Gamboa Jr., a founding member of the Chicano art collective ASCO (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  “There was another era when people said, ‘Latinx art, you know, doesn’t exist. It’s not a thing. It doesn’t belong. It’s not part of American art,’” said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of theLucas Museum of Narrative Art. ASCO’s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In “Station of the Cross,” the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War. In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media’s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story. ASCO’s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted “ASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,” the first retrospective to present the group’s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment. “Latino history has always been erased,” said Gutiérrez Senger. “‘ASCO: Without Permission’ is a story of winning a battle, not a war.” A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards — a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on thelack of Latino representation in Hollywood. The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member. “Hollywood movies, rock ’n’ roll. That’s what I was about,” said Valdez. “And that’s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.” Gamboa photographed Herrón, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called “No Movies” and later inspired their satirical award show. Gutiérrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists — including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha — in short films inspired by ASCO’s signature DIY style. “I think it’s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you’re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,” said Gutiérrez Senger. “We have rich stories, and we have a rich history.” Travis Gutiérrez Senger’s latest documentary, “ASCO: Without Permission” chronicles the story of a 1970s Chicano art group named “asco.” Their name translates to “nausea” or “disgust” in Spanish. ASCO used their conceptual work and performance art to speak of issues related to the Chicano civil rights movement. (March 27) “ASCO: Without Permission” includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, includingactor Michael Peñaandcomedian Arturo Castro,who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history. “Our history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we’ve had are not in the history books,” Peña says in the documentary. Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and “misbehave and not ask for permission.” “You do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,” said Gamboa. “And the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)         WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is pushing the House of Representatives to pass a measure that would prevent immediate financial disaster for the District of Columbia even as he continues to level harsh criticism at the city and its leaders. In a Friday morning post on Truth Social, he wrote, “The House should take up the D.C. funding ‘fix’ that the Senate has passed, and get it done IMMEDIATELY.” It’s the first direct public indication from the Republican president that he supports efforts to restore a $1.1 billion hole in the district’s budget, and it’s a major boost for Democratic Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s campaign to reverse a legislative change that she says woulddevastate the capital city. Earlier this month, the House passeda federal government funding billthat would force the district’s government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its budget midway through the financial year. Bowser spearheaded an intense congressional lobbying campaign to prevent the change, saying it would result in immediate across-the-board cuts to staffing and programs, including teachers and police officers being laid off. The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut butimmediately followed upwith a separate bill that would make the district’s budget whole again. That measure now awaits House approval, and Bowser has delayed unveiling her 2026 budget plan until the issue is resolved.  Despite indications that Trump supported the budget fix, he had not publicly weighed in until now. The House adjourns for its spring recess on April 11, and House Republican leadership has remained vague on the topic, with Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana saying Tuesday that it was too early to confirm when the House would vote on the budget fix. “We’re working through that,” Johnson said. Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana said earlier this week that the district’s claim of financial ruin “sounds overstated.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Thursday that the April 11 recess provides a natural deadline and a sense of urgency. “It needs to happen before we go on the next district work period, which means it should occur either next week or the week after next,” Jeffries said. Speaking before Trump’s Friday posting, Jeffries said, “apparently even Donald Trump himself has expressed support for the need to correct this egregious error.” Trump’s endorsement of the budget fix comes amid a flurry of attention on the nation’s capital, with the president issuing a series of statements and executive orders targeting crime, homelessness, immigration policy and gun control in the district. On Thursday night, Trump issued an executive order establishing the inter-departmental D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force, which he said would coordinate with local officials on such things as enforcing federal immigration law, including deporting people living illegally in the city, boosting the law enforcement presence and increasing the speed and lowering the cost of processing applications to carry concealed weapons. “America’s capital must be a place in which residents, commuters, and tourists feel safe at all hours, including on public transit. Its highways, boulevards, and parks should be clean, well-kept, and pleasant,” the order stated. “Its monuments, museums, and buildings should reflect and inspire awe and appreciation for our Nation’s strength, greatness, and heritage.” And despite the support for the budget fix, Trump’s Friday morning posting also came with criticism of the nation’s capital and a warning: “We need to clean up our once beautiful Capital City, and make it beautiful again.” “We will be TOUGH ON CRIME, like never before,” Trump wrote. “I will work with the Mayor on this and, if it does not happen, will have no choice but to do it myself.” Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s non-voting delegate in the House, hailed Trump’s support for the budget fix and tied the issue into Washington’s longstanding and increasingly beleaguered campaign to become the 51st state. “As surprised as I am to have an occasion to agree with President Trump, in this instance, we agree that D.C. should be able to spend its own local funds at its own locally enacted levels,” Norton, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This ordeal, however, only helps to highlight the need for D.C. statehood so that D.C. can finally govern itself to the same extent afforded to the states, including making decisions about how to use its own local funds.” Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Kevin Freking and Leah Askarinam contributed to this report.

Lawyer says an Iranian student targeted for ‘national security concerns’ was not a campus protestor,https://apnews.com/article/campus-protests-immigration-alireza-doroudi-alabama-ae498838deb04b22864ef485a71bac27,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — An Iranian doctoral student at the University of Alabama was arrested by immigration agents at his apartment in the middle of the night, even though his lawyer said he was allowed to stay in the country and — unlike some students targeted for deportation — never participated in campus protests. Alireza Doroudi, 32, was picked up because his visa was revoked in 2023, one of the few points of agreement between U.S. officials and the student’s representatives. David Rozas, a lawyer for Doroudi, said he didn’t know why his client’s visa was revoked but that he could stay in the United States while he remained a student, a status that immigration attorneys say is somewhat common. “He has not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests. He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering,” Rozas said. The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that immigration officials acted on the State Department’s visa revocation. “This individual posed significant national security concerns,” the department said. Officials declined to elaborate when asked why he is considered a threat. Rozas said he has not been informed of any allegations of security issues involving Doroudi. Carl Shusterman, a Los Angeles immigration attorney not involved in the case, said it has become “fairly common” in recent years for students to have their visas revoked, perhaps for a crime like driving under the influence. The revocation prohibits them from re-entering the country but they may stay if they remain students.  Doroudi was being held at the Pickens County Jail in Carrollton, Alabama, and was to be sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Jena, Louisiana, a town of about 5,000 people far from any major city. Doroudi’s is the latest in a string of immigration arrests involving college students, several of whom are being held in rural Louisiana, whichbecame a detention hubduring President Donald Trump’s first term. Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student facing deportation for his role in pro-Palestinian campus protests,urged a federal judge on Fridayto move their client’s case out of the Jena detention center, describing his imprisonment there as a “Kafkaesque” ploy to chill free speech. Also Friday, lawyers for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, renewed a legal bid challenging her detention by immigration officialsas she walked along a streetin the Boston suburb of Somerville on Tuesday. Ozturk, 30, was moved to an ICE detention center in remote Basile, Louisiana, before a federal judge ordered her to be kept in Massachusetts. Trump has yet to deliver on campaign pledges of mass deportations but, while the numbers may not be so striking, his administration’s targets and methods mark a major break from his predecessors’, including his own practices during his first term. He invokeda rarely-used wartime powers actto send hundreds of Venezuelans to prison in El Salvador. Agents from ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations unit knocked on Doroudi’s door at 3 a.m. Tuesday. His attorney said his client thought it was a home invasion. “All we’ve been informed is that ICE notified him at the jail and said, ’Hey, you are a citizen of Iran. Because of the long period from the time of revocation, we don’t believe that you should stay here. And he is like, ‘I’m in school.’ And they were like,” Well, show us proof that you’ve been in school, and you can show that to the court,’” Rozas said. Neighbors who didn’t want to be identified told The Associated Press they were awoken by the knock and and felt terrified as they witnessed the arrest. The University of Alabama confirmed that a student was detained off campus by immigration authorities. “International students studying at the University are valued members of the campus community,” the school said in a statement. “UA has and will continue to follow all immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities.” Doroudi has an immigration hearing in early April, according to his attorney, who worries that Doroudi’s inability to attend school will result in his loss of student status. Publicly available Alabama court records show he was cited for speeding/reckless driving in November 2023 but no other legal entanglements. Chandler reported from Montgomery, Alabama.

Will Smith channels his post-slap introspection into music on ‘Based on a True Story’,https://apnews.com/article/will-smith-based-on-true-story-interview-acff9d0c743df50da7110d7e4d9f143b,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. LOS ANGELES (AP) —Will Smithcould have let hisinfamous Oscar slapbe his cinematic fade out with a career bruised, marriage dissected and reputation in a free fall. But instead of retreating, he turned inward for self-reflection. In the process, Smith rediscovered a long-neglected creative outlet in music, using the mic as a vessel to voice his thoughts after years of prioritizing his Hollywood dominance. “I’ve taken the last couple of years to really do a deep dive on the parts of me that may or may not been in that level of certainty and asking those deep scary internal questions,” said Smith, an Oscar and Grammy winner, who will release his fifth studio album “Based on a True Story” on Friday. It’s his first music project in two decades since “Lost and Found.” “It really is the result of my initial self-examination,” he said. “Every song is about some part of myself that I discovered or wanted to explore, something I wanted to share. It’s the most full musical offering that I’ve ever created.” Smith’s new offering features guest appearances from Big Sean,Teyana Taylor,DJ Jazzy Jeff,his son Jaden Smith, Jac Ross and Kanye West’s Sunday Service Choir. His album weaves in gospel melodies and messages, but he doesn’t call it a full-blown gospel project, despite the success of“You Can Make It,”which soared to No. 1 on the Billboard Gospel Airplay chart. Still, Smith let his renewed faith take the lead, steering his creative direction. He plans to release three albums this year, shaping each project into what he calls seasons.  The first season, Rave in the Wasteland, plays out across the 14 tracks of “Based on True Story” and represents his willingness to learn from life’s lessons. “I’ve come to some really beautiful answers for myself,” Smith said. “My perception of God and reality.” Though Smith, 56, is still a bankable global star, rebuilding trust and momentum has been an uphill battle. He’s grappled with harsh realities while trying to move past the backlash fromslapping Chris Rockat the Oscars in 2022 and his10-year ban from the ceremony. Will Smith is focusing on self-improvement while his 10-year ban from the Oscars, for slapping Chris Rock, is in force. (March 24) Several entertainers — including Zoë Kravitz, Wanda Sykes and Rob Reiner — criticized Smith’s actions. Jim Carrey was particularly vocal, stating that Smith had been “living beyond the bandwidth” and cracked under the pressure. When asked about Carrey’s “bandwidth” remark, Smith agreed but reiterated that he needed to step back to gain a deeper understanding of himself and move beyond his own limitations. “There’s a small self that — the small concept of myself - can get to the end of his bandwidth,” he said. “And then, if I back up, there’s like an infinite space, where my bandwidth is the bandwidth of life itself. It’s like trying to not get stuck in having to be only a narrow band of things, to give myself permission to be wider in the truth of who and what I actually am.” Smith’s road to redemption grew tougher when Rock’s comedy special reignited the controversy and his wifeJada Pinkett Smith’s memoir “Worthy”put their marriage under fresh scrutiny, sparking headlines and endless social media memes. Smith said the adversity not only tested him but fueled his creativity. “There’s a certain psychological and emotional fortitude that you cultivate from, leaning into the difficulty, not trying to run away,” said Smith, who added he sought to build “spiritual confidence” inspired by the resilience of his late grandmother and Nelson Mandela. Along the way, he found Tibetan Buddhist Pema Chödrön’s teachings, embracing her mantra of “leaning into the sharp points.” These influences became pillars as Smith explored himself more deeply. The way his grandmother, Mandela and Chödrön approached life pushed him to channel his journey back into music. “It is essentially learning how to accept and celebrate my challenges, recognizing that my challenges and my obstacles and my difficulties are actually divine curriculum,” said Smith, a four-time Grammy winner, who is known for rap classics such as “Summertime,” “Men in Black,” “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It” and “Parents Just Don’t Understand.” Those tracks had a laid-back feel, but his new album strikes a more serious tone. “It’s what I’ve been given to learn the truth,” he continued. “There’s a way that I’m learning to be with hard times when things arise. It’s like ‘Good, yes, thank you.’ I’m willing to learn these lessons.” Believe it or not, Smith is set to embark on his first-ever headline tour this summer. He is structuring the shows around different phases of his life and career: One featuring Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff, another highlighting his film and TV journey and third act he calls the “new phase, new energy,” where Jeff and others will return to the stage. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  Smith will kick off his tour including festivals starting June 25 at the Mawazine festival in Morocco and expected to wrap up early September in Paris. He’ll perform his past hits from “Miami” to “Summertime” along with songs from the new album across England, France and Germany. As Smith gears up for his tour, he also has several films in pre-production, including “Fast and Loose,” “Hancock 2,” “I Am Legend 2” and “Planes, Trains and Automobiles,” according to IMDb. He’s embracing this next phase of his career with renewed energy. “This is about to be the greatest creative run of my entire career,” he said. “The things that I’m about to do in music and cinema, and just artistic expression and exploration. It’s like, I can’t sleep at night. I’m so ready to go.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(ESA/Webb via AP) WASHINGTON (AP) —Neptune’sglowing auroras are captured in the best detail yet byNASA’s James WebbSpace Telescope. Hints of auroras were first faintly detected in ultraviolet light during a flyby of the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. Webb captured Neptune’s shimmering lights in infrared light, providing direct evidence they exist. NASA released the images on Wednesday, and the results were published in the journalNature Astronomy. Auroras on any planet occur when electrically charged particles from space enter and collide with molecules in the atmosphere, creating a series of reactions that emits light. On Earth, auroras tend to occur near the polar regions, producing spectacular northern and southern lights. Scientists have studied auroras on Saturn and Jupiter for decades, but Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, has been harder to see up close. “Neptune has always been elusive,” said University of Reading planetary scientist James O’Donoghue, co-author of the new study. Its auroras “had only been seen by Voyager, and we’ve been trying to see it again ever since.” Neptune’s auroras occur near the mid-latitudes of the planet, not the polar regions, because of differences in its magnetic field, which determine the span of auroras, said O’Donoghue. More than three decades after Voyager 2’s pass, scientists have seen Neptune’s auroras again with the powerful Webb telescope, producing “the first robust detection,” co-author Heidi Hammel of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, said in an email. The researchers also revealed that Neptune’s atmosphere has cooled significantly since the 1980s, which may have somewhat dimmed the light of the auroras.

(AP Photo/Jessica Tobias)           Deion Sanders broughtback the glitter— and the wins — to a downtrodden program in just two seasons. For that, the Colorado Buffaloes rewarded the charismatic coach with a contract extension through the 2029 season, making him the highest-paid football coach in the Big 12 Conference and among the most lucratively paid across the country. His five-year, $54 million extension includes $10 million in each of the first two seasons, $11 million in the next two and $12 million in Year 5. The deal was reached with three years remaining on Sanders’ existing five-year, $29.5 million deal he signed when he was brought in from Jackson State. “Coach Prime has revolutionized college football and in doing so, has restored CU football to our rightful place as a national power,” athletic director Rick George said in a statement. “This extension not only recognizes Coach’s incredible accomplishments transforming our program on and off the field, it keeps him in Boulder to compete for conference and national championships in the years to come.” Sanders and the Buffaloes are coming off a 9-4 season in which they earned a spot in the Alamo Bowl. The Buffaloes have big cleats to fill, though. They’re losing Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter and Sanders’ sons, Shedeur — a projected high pick in the upcoming NFL draft — and Shilo. Next season will mark the first time in many years that Deion Sanders won’t be coaching one of his kids.  Sanders and his high-profile staff have assembled another talented recruiting class — from high school recruits to transfer portal additions. The headliners of the class are Liberty transfer quarterback Kaidon Salter, Alabama transfer defensive lineman Jaheim Oatis and Julian “JuJu” Lewis, a five-star high school quarterback who arrived on campus early to get a head start. Either Salter or Lewis figures to step in and take over for Shedeur Sanders as Colorado attempts to make back-to-back bowl games for the first time since 2004 and 2005. With Sanders’ decision to stay put, the Buffaloes avoid all sorts of mass exodus — from the new fans and celebrities he’s attracted to all the media attention the Buffaloes have received. In addition, the high-level recruits who were lured to town by the presence of Sanders figure to be staying, too. Should Sanders take another job — in the NFL or another NCAA team — his buyout is $12 million if he terminates the deal on or before December 31, 2025; $10 million in 2026, $6 million in 2027, $4 million in 2028 and $3 million in 2029. Among his incentives are $150,000 if the Buffaloes win nine games in the regular season and $100,000 for each additional victory in the regular season. He also receives $150,000 if the team plays in the Big 12 title game and $150,000 if Colorado is invited to a non-college football playoff bowl. It’s $400,000 should the team win the conference championship or appear in the first round of the College Football Playoff. A first-round win earns him another $50,000. From there, it’s $100,000 for the semifinals; $200,000 for the championship game and $250,000 if the Buffaloes win the national championship. His selection as the Big 12 Coach of the Year would earn him $75,000 and the national award $150,000. He’s certainly helped raise the profile of Colorado since taking over: — 22 of Colorado’s 24 games have been selected to be on network television or the flagship ESPN. — The two highest average home attendance seasons have been 2023 (53,180 fans) and last season (52,514). — Colorado was sixth in viewership during the 2024 regular season, trailing only Georgia, Ohio State, Alabama, Texas and Michigan. — The football team generated $31.2 million in ticket sales in Sanders’ first season in Boulder (a 4-8 record), according to the annual University of Colorado athletics NCAA financial reports. The program had $13 million in ticket sales the year before his arrival. — Colorado has seen its applications to attend the school increase 20% from a year ago. — Home football games have meant a combined $93.9 million in direct economic impact for Boulder and $146.5 million in regional economic impact, according to the school. “To be honest, I don’t think that anybody fully was prepared for just how much national and international attention Coach Prime would generate for our community and the economic benefits that it would also engender,” John Tayer, the president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber, recently said in an interview. “There’s just a great deal of enthusiastic energy.” The success has carried over into the classroom as well. The football team had a GPA of 3.011 for the fall semester. It’s the first time the football program has been over 3.0, the school announced. “We’ve just scratched the surface of what this program can be,” Sanders said in a statement. “It’s not just about football; it’s about developing young men who are ready to take on the world. I’m committed to bringing greatness to this university, on and off the field. We’ve got work to do, and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else but here, making history with these incredible players and this passionate fan base. “Lastly, anybody got at least a five bedroom home with acreage for sale?” AP college football:https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-pollandhttps://apnews.com/hub/college-football   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(UPMC/Pitt Health Sciences via AP)            WASHINGTON (AP) — A man who battled childhood cancer has received the first knowntransplant of sperm-producing stem cells, in a study aimed at restoring the fertility of cancer’s youngest survivors. Jaiwen Hsu was 11 when a leg injury turned out to be bone cancer. Doctors thoughtgrueling chemotherapycould save him but likely leave him infertile. His parents learned researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were freezing testicular cells ofyoung boys with cancerin hopes of preserving their future fertility — and signed him up. Hsu, now 26, is the first to return as an adult and test if reimplanting those cells might work. “The science behind it is so incredibly new that right now it’s kind of a waiting game,” said Hsu, of Vienna, Virginia. “It’s kind of eagerly crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.” It may seem unusual to discuss future fertility when a family is reeling from the diagnosis of a child’s cancer. But 85% of children with cancer now survive to adulthood and about 1 in 3 are left infertile from chemotherapy or radiation. Young adults with cancer can bank sperm, eggs or sometimes embryos ahead of treatment. But children diagnosed before puberty don’t have that option because they’re not yet producing mature sperm or eggs. Boys are born with stem cells inside spaghetti-like tubes in the testes, cells that start producing sperm after puberty sparks a rise in testosterone. Withfunding from the National Institutes of Health, Pitt reproductive scientist Kyle Orwig studies how to preserve and potentially use testicular cells to restore fertility.  It starts with a biopsy-like removal of a small amount of testicular tissue that contains millions of cells – some of them precious sperm-producing stem cells.Since 2011, Orwig’s team has frozen samplesfrom about 1,000 prepubertal boys. It’s impossible to tell if enough stem cells are in each tiny sample to matter. But in 2019, Orwig used preserved testicular tissue from a young male monkey that, in an animal version of IVF, led to the birth of a healthy baby monkey. By 2023, Orwig was ready to reimplant now-grown cancer survivors’ cells when Hsu — not ready to start a family yet but curious about his long-ago study participation — reached out. “We’re not expecting a miracle result,” cautioned Orwig, whose colleagues transplanted Hsu’s thawed cells in November 2023. In a paperposted onlinethis week, Orwig reported the injection, guided by ultrasound to the right spot, was safe and easy to perform. His work has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. And Orwig said it’s too soon to know if the experiment worked and standard tests likely won’t tell, as animal testing found assisted reproduction techniques were needed to detect and retrieve small amounts of sperm. Still, he hopes the ongoing research will alert more families to consider fertility preservation so they’d have the option if it eventually pans out. Belgian researchers announced a similar experiment in January, implanting pieces of testicular tissue rather than cells in a childhood cancer survivor. “These developments are of great importance,” said researcher Ellen Goossens of Vrije Universiteit Brussel. While animal research “was very promising, transplantations in humans will be the only way” to tell if this really works. Similar research with immature ovarian tissue is underway for female childhood cancer survivors, too, noted Dr. Mahmoud Salama, who directs the Oncofertility Consortium at Michigan State University. Hsu said even if his experimental transplant doesn’t work, it will guide further research. He’s grateful his parents years ago “made a call that gave me the option to make the choice for myself today.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)       President Donald Trump’s administration is terminating grants for two clean energy projects and roughly 300 others funded by the Department of Energy are in jeopardy as the president prioritizes fossil fuels. The DOE is canceling two awards to a nonprofit clean energy think tank, RMI in Colorado, according to a document from the agency confirming the cancellations that was reviewed by The Associated Press on Friday. One was for nearly $5.3 million to retrofit low-income multifamily buildings in Massachusetts and California to demonstrate ways to reduce the use of energy and lower planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The other was for $1.5 million to assess business models for electric vehicle carsharing in U.S. cities. The department wrote that it had determined the awards do not meet the administration’s objectives. Both awards are on a list of about 300 clean energy projects under review. President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency early in his term and is working to speed up fossil fuel development, which he sums up as“drill, baby, drill.” Attendees holding signs that say “drill baby drill!” as Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at Alro Steel, Aug. 29, 2024, in Potterville, Mich. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)  The burning of oil, gas and coal is the main contributor to global warming caused by human activity. President Joe Biden tried to lock in a trajectory for reducing the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. As his term came to an end,his administration raced to award billionsof dollars for clean energy and approved major offshore wind projects. RMI spokeswoman Dina Cappiello confirmed the organization had received a termination letter for the EV carsharing viability work, and had anticipated it. That work won’t proceed as a result of the funding being pulled back. As of Friday afternoon, she said she hadn’t seen a second letter, but the retrofitting work is due to finish in June using a grant announced during Trump’s first term.  The Department of Energy said in a statement late Friday that the department “acted in the best interest of the American people” by terminating the grants. As for other grants on the list, the statement said, the department is still conducting a wide-ranging review. E&E News first reported last weekthat the DOE was creating a “hit list” of clean energy projects awarded billions of dollars that the Trump administration could wipe out. The list, obtained by the AP, includes wind, solar, battery storage and electric vehicle infrastructure projects. It includes funding to help heavy industries transition away from fossil fuels and funding to decarbonize buildings. Many projects were funded through the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure lawBiden signed in 2021. Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency terminatedgrant agreements this month worth $20 billionissued by the Biden administration under a so-calledgreen bankto finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects. A federal judge has blocked the administration from ending the grant program for now. Wind turbines are operate in Goldendale, Wash., on March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)  U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, said halting clean energy projects will increase energy costs for families and businesses, and the Energy Department must carry out duly-enacted spending laws. “We need the Department of Energy to work with us, not against us, to lower energy costs and help create good-paying jobs, but at a bare minimum, we demand the department to follow the law as intended,” Kaptur, the top Democrat of the House Appropriations energy subcommittee, said in a statement. RMI has received government contracts and grants under Republican and Democratic administrations since its founding in 1982. Cappiello said that money has been used to help advance secure, reliable, efficient and clean energy solutions. The current administration’s actions will slow and could eventually halt the many benefits of moving a clean energy agenda forward, such as lowering energy costs, making communities resilient and creating jobs, she said in a statement. Installation of renewable energy worldwidehit a record high last year, with 92.5% of all new electricity brought online coming from the sun, wind or other clean sources, according to a Wednesday report by the International Renewable Energy Agency. China led the way, with nearly 64% of the new renewable electricity capacity in 2024 installed there.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)                                  DA NANG, Vietnam (AP) — Bui Van Phong faced a choice when the Vietnam War ended 50 years ago: Stay in his small village, helping his parents carry on the family’s centuries-old tradition of making fish sauce, or join the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing his country for a better life.  Phong chose to stay behind and nurtured a business making the beloved condiment, known as nuoc mam in Vietnam, that is now in its fourth generation with his son, Bui Van Phu, 41, at the helm. Fish sauce from the village has been recognized by Vietnam as an indelible part of the country’s heritage and the younger Bui is acutely aware of what that means.  “It isn’t just the quality of fish sauce. It is also the historical value,” he said.  But that heritage is under threat, and not only from giant conglomerates that mass-produce fish sauce in factories. Climate change and overfishing are making it harder to catch the anchovies essential to the condiment that underlies so much of Vietnam and southeast Asia’s food.  Anchovies thrive in large schools in nutrient-rich waters near the shore. But climate change is warming the oceans, depleting oxygen levels in the water. Scientists have long feared that this would lead to smaller fish, as large fish that need more oxygen may migrate or adapt over time by shrinking. Renato Salvatteci, who studies fisheries at the Christian-Albrecht University of Kiel in Germany, said his research into warmer periods millenia ago found support for this in the fossil record.  “If we continue with this trend of deoxygenation, anchovies will not be OK with that,” he said. “Every species has a limit.”   Breaching that limit will have global consequences. Fishers retrieve a net on Nguyen Tat Thanh beach on March, 6, 2025, in Da Nang, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   Warming oceans threaten the ocean ecology and the marine life that inhabits it. It may result in the proliferation of smaller, less nutritious fish and increase costs of fishing and consequently food. Anchovies, for instance, have an outsized role on marine ecology. They’re food for other fish that people eat, like mackerel. They are also vital to make fish meal, used to feed farmed fish.  Overfishing compounds the problem, and geopolitical tensions in the contested waters of the South China Sea — responsible for about 12% of the global fish catch — make management difficult. The destructive industrial fishing practice of dragging large nets along the seabed, scooping up everything in a net’s path, has prevailed since the 1980s. But despite increased fishing, the amount of fish being caught has stagnated, according to a2020 analysis of fishing trends.  Even if the world can limit long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels and halve fishing intensity, the South China Sea will still lose more than a fifth of its fish stocks, warned a 2021assessmentby scientists from the University of British Columbia in Canada. In the most pessimistic scenario — temperatures rising by 7.7 degrees Fahrenheit (4.3 degrees) — nearly all the fish disappear.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   Phu, who teaches information technology by day, also works hard to perfect the fish sauce art handed down by his ancestors.  The anchovies are usually caught between January to March when they congregate off the coast of Da Nang. If they are the right species and size, they get mixed gently with sea salt and put in special tera cotta barrels. Sometimes worms or other ingredients are added to bring in different flavors. Phu ferments this for up to 18 months — stirring the mix several times a week — before it can be strained, bottled and sold to customers.  The sea salt imparts different flavor depending on where it comes from. So does the amount of salt used, and makers have their own recipes; the Bui family uses three parts fish to one part salt. The time allowed for fermentation, and the potential addition of other fish, also affect the flavor of the final product.

(AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)  Worms crawl in the fish sauce made in Nam O fishing village, on March 5, 2025, in Da Nang, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   But it is harder to get the perfect anchovies. The fish catch has decreased — fishermen in markets across Vietnam rue the fact that much of the fish they sell now was considered bait-size in previous decades — and it’s only the good relationships he has with anchovy fishermen that allow him to get the fish directly, avoiding high market prices. The unmistakeable aroma of fermenting fish cloaks the homes of families that still make traditional fish sauce. But Phu said that many families are thinking of getting out of the business because of high anchovy prices.  That may affect Vietnamese plans for a bigger share of the global fish sauce market — projected to increase in value from $18.5 billion in 2023 to nearly $29 billion by 2032, according to a report by Introspective Market Research. Vietnam, along with Thailand, is the world’s largest exporter of fish sauce and is hoping improvements in food safety to satisfy standards in lucrative markets like the U.S., Europe and Japan will help cement a national brand that helps advertise Vietnamese culture to the world.  It’s hard to overemphasize how deeply the condiment is enmeshed in Vietnamese culture. Students living abroad speak of how its taste transports them back home and a top chef says it’s the foundation for flavor in the country’s cuisine. The varying taste of different brews also means everyone — from top businessmen to daily wage workers — has their own opinions about which is the best.  Phu said that each family has their own secrets about making fish sauce. And, nearly fifty years since his father chose to stay back and take care of the family business, he’d like to pass those on to his own son. But he knows that it’ll depend on whether enough anchovies thrive in the sea for the craft to be viable.  “Fish sauce to me is not just a condiment for cooking. But it is our craft, our culture, our tradition that need to be preserved, safeguarded and inherited,” he said.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — As the nature offinancial crimechanges, with technology and AI increasingly used to perpetrate illegal acts, the IRS’ crime fighting arm —IRS Criminal Investigation— is announcing a new program intended to improve how it interacts with financial institutions. Called Feedback in Response to Strategic Threat —or CI-FIRST— the program unveiled Friday is intended to speed up subpoena requests, give banks better data on how to detect criminal activity and build out investigations faster and more efficiently. Under theBank Secrecy Act, banks and financial institutions are required to send over a variety of suspicious activity reports to the federal government after detecting potential money laundering or terrorist financing. The goal for CI-FIRST is to help financial institutions more easily detect and report financial crimes tied to fentanyl trafficking, drug trafficking, human smuggling and other crimes — by streamlining subpoena requests and improving data-sharing with banks. IRS-CI Chief Guy Ficco said in a statement that “public-private partnerships thrive when everyone mutually benefits.” Also on Friday, IRS Criminal Investigation released new statistics highlighting how the agency has investigated financial crimes using Bank Secrecy Act data. The agency found $21.1 billion in fraud tied to tax and financial crimes from 2022 to 2024, seized $8.2 billion in assets tied to criminal activity in the same period, and recouped $1.4 billion in restitution for crime victims, according to the agency.  “Behind all of these metrics are real crimes with real victims,” said Lauren Kohr, IRS-CI’s strategic engagement adviser. “A lot of times people look at BSA data or the Bank Secrecy Act as a regulatory requirement, but it’s really one of the sharpest tools law enforcement as a whole has to trace fraud illicit money and dismantle these criminal networks.” “And when illicit money moves, it’s these BSA reports,” she said “that tell us the story.” IRS-CI special agents ran an average of 966,900 searches annually against currency transaction reports. A currency transaction report, or CTR, is a financial document that banks are required to file with Treasury for any cash transaction exceeding $10,000 in a single day. In the past three years, roughly 67% of cases opened by IRS-CI involved one or more currency transaction reports below $40,000, with half of currency transaction reports involving amounts less than $22,230. Despite the majority of reports coming in below $40,000, a group of Republican lawmakers is pursing raising the threshold. Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk and nine other House Republicans have sponsored a bill called the Financial Reporting Threshold Modernization Act, which would raise the currency transaction reporting and Suspicious Activity Reporting thresholds to $30,000 and $10,000, respectively, and index the CTR threshold for inflation every five years. On April 1, the House Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutionswill hold a hearingon April 1 and the issue of CTR thresholds will come up. Last December a Government Accountability Office report recommended Treasury help to “reduce the number of CTRs filed that are not used by law enforcement,such as by raising the reporting thresholdor expanding criteria to allow for further exemptions.” In addition to their financial crimes work, IRS Criminal Investigations has been called upon by the Trump administration to help with immigration enforcement. Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noemsent a request to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workersto help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS’s boost in funding, through the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act hasalready been clawed back.

Charlie Javice convicted of defrauding JPMorgan during $175 million sale of financial aid startup,https://apnews.com/article/charlie-javice-convicted-fraud-jp-morgan-783cb7b089f6ab5d814c4c0984f0302b,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Charlie Javice leaves Federal Court, Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) NEW YORK (AP) —Charlie Javice, the charismatic founder of a startup company that claimed to be revolutionizing the way college students apply for financial aid, was convicted Friday of defrauding one of the world’s largest banks, JPMorgan Chase, out of $175 million by exaggerating her customer base tenfold. A jury returned the verdict after a five-week trial in federal court in Manhattan. Javice, 32, and her co-defendant, Olivier Amar, face the possibility of decades in prison in a case that has drawn comparisons to Theranos founderElizabeth Holmes. Javice appeared sullen at the defense table as the verdict was read. A lawyer placed her hand on Javice’s back. She brushed past reporters and didn’t speak as she left court. Javice was in her mid-20s when she founded Frank, a company with software that promised to simplify the arduous process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a complex government form used by students to apply for aid for college or graduate school. The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank’s profile, once appearing onForbes’ “30 Under 30” listbefore JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021. JPMorgan executives testified that Javice told them she had more than four million clients and would have about 10 million by year’s end, but it turned out there were only about 300,000 customers and a list verifying her outsized claim was largely bogus.  Javice’s lawyer, Jose Baez, told the jury that JPMorgan knew what it was getting in the deal, accusing the bank of making up the fraud allegations because of buyer’s remorse after regulatory changes made the data it received in the deal useless to its hopes of gaining new young customers. Defense lawyers asked the judge to set aside the verdict, arguing the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction. Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said he would hear arguments on that next week and resolve a dispute over whether Javice and Amar must wear ankle monitors while awaiting sentencing on July 23. Javice’s lawyers argued the device will interfere with her new career: teaching Pilates classes for three or four hours a day. Javice, who lived in Florida, has been free on $2 million bail sinceher 2023 arrest. Javice and Amar, Frank’s chief growth and acquisition officer and effectively its No. 2, were convicted on all four counts in their indictments, including conspiracy, bank fraud and wire fraud charges that are each punishable by up to 30 years in prison. “While Javice and Amar may have thought that they could lie and cheat their way to a huge payday, their lies caught up with them, and they now stand convicted by a jury of their peers,” Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said in a statement. Javice was among a number ofyoung tech executiveswho vaulted to fame with supposedly disruptive or transformative companies, only to see them collapse amid questions about whether they had engaged in puffery andfraud while dealing with investors. Javice founded Frank soon after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, saying she was motivated by her own frustrations navigating the financial aid process. Frank’s backers included venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg. The company said its offering, akin to online tax preparation software, could help students maximize financial aid while making the application process less painful. JPMorgan became interested partly because of the potential it saw in Frank’s supposedly huge list of satisfied clients. The bank believed those future college graduates could become lifelong bank customers. But after buying the company, JPMorgan said it found evidence Javice had lied about Frank’s success. Frank’s chief software engineer, Patrick Vovor, testified that Javice had asked him to generate synthetic data to support her claim that the company had more than 4 million users. When Vovor asked if that was legal, prosecutors said, Javice and Amar assured him that it was — and told him they didn’t want to end up in orange prison jumpsuits. Vovor testified that he refused to help. “I told them I would not do anything illegal,” Vovor told jurors. Seeking to dent Vovor’s credibility, defense lawyers suggested he was resentful that Javice didn’t want to date him. He denied that. Prosecutors said Javice ended up paying a college friend $18,000 to create millions of fake names with pedigree information. The results were sent to JPMorgan’s third-party data provider, but testimony showed that firm never checked to ensure the people were real. “JPMorgan is not telling the truth,” Baez argued. “They knew the numbers.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Israeli settlers seen on camera assaulting a Palestinian village. Police arrest only Palestinians,https://apnews.com/article/israel-settler-attack-palestinians-masafer-yatta-5fca78a22e3c606ae55734770cb7aa41,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Over a dozen Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian village in the southern Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, beating residents with sticks and rocks, in an incident captured with rare clarity by security cameras. The video obtained by AP and testimonies from Palestinian witnesses appeared to conflict with the account of the attack provided by Israeli police and military, who arrested over 20 Palestinians afterwards. JERUSALEM (AP) — Over a dozen Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian village in the southern Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, beating residents with sticks and rocks, in an incident captured with rare clarity by security cameras. The video obtained by AP and testimonies from Palestinian witnesses appeared to conflict with the account of the attack provided by Israeli police and military, who arrested over 20 Palestinians afterwards. The violence in the village of Jinba follows a settler attack earlier this week in a nearby village in whichHamdan Ballal, a Palestinianco-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” was left bloodied and bruised before being detained by Israeli soldiers for about 20 hours. The videos provide uncommonly stark images of the type of settler assault Palestinians in the West Bank say now occurs frequently. They say radical Jewish settlers rarely, if ever, face repercussions for attacking Palestinian communities, while Palestinians are often rounded up in droves and detained by Israeli forces.  AP obtained footage from two security cameras belonging to the Al-Amur family, whose home came under attack. Footage from one camera shows a jeep, an ATV and a white pick-up truck speed up to the edge of the village. A number of settlers pile out of them and run out of the frame, and the screams of Palestinian women can be heard. The settlers then return into view, and at least 15 of them ascend a slope, getting closer to the camera. Many are masked, at least three are carrying bats or sticks, and one is armed with an assault rifle. One can be seen throwing a rock, then bending to collect more. The matriarch of the Al-Amur family, Oula Awad, said she saw the settlers approaching her house between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM, as she was doing laundry outside with her daughter. Her son, Qusai, 17, and husband, Aziz, 63, were washing up to prepare for Ramadan prayers when the settlers pulled up in vehicles and emerged. “The settler runs toward me and told me, ‘Don’t wave. Do not move forward. We will hit you,’” she said. In security footage taken from a different camera at the house, she and her daughter, 16-year-old Handa, are seen screaming and waving clothes in the air, calling for help. At one point, Awad makes a motion waving her arms. It is not clear if she throws something at a settler rushing toward her. The settlers are then seen converging on Qusai. One settler begins hitting him with a stick as he tries to run away. Another settler smashes his head with a rock, sending him to the ground. Four settlers then kick and beat him before running away. This grab taken from video shows a masked man with a stick, left, beating Palestinian Qusay Al-Amur in his house in the West Bank village of Jinba, Friday, March 28, 2025. (UGC via AP)  Awad said the settlers locked her and her daughter in a side room as they beat her younger son, Ahmad, and her husband Aziz. “They entered the room and hit the windows,” said Awad. They tried to burn the furniture. “My husband was standing on the stairs, and they started beating him.” A video taken by Qusai and shared with the AP showed Ahmad on the ground with a head laceration. Aziz lies nearby, his face bloodied. Palestinian Qusai Al-Amur sits in a hospital bed next to his relatives following an attack by Israeli settlers on his West Bank village of Jinba, Friday, March 28, 2025. (Basel Adra via AP)  Five Palestinians remain in hospitals. Aziz had a chest injury and underwent surgery for skull fractures; Ahmed, 16, is in intensive care. Qusai suffered a broken arm, bruises and cuts. Another villager, Maher Mohammed, had cuts and bruises, as did his son Osama, who was also undergoing kidney examinations. Nidal Younis, the head of the Masafer Yatta village council, witnessed part of the attack and was detained by police for two hours afterward. He said soldiers who arrived on scene following the attack prevented Palestinians from nearby villages from helping and threw stun grenades at homes, a claim to which the military did not respond. Following the incident, Israeli police said they detained 22 Palestinians from the village on suspicion of stone throwing and brought them in for further investigation. They said Palestinians had attacked two settler shepherds nearby, minorly injuring them. “The security forces view the series of attacks in the area seriously, and will take strong action to bring those involved to justice,” the police said. They did not respond when asked by the AP why no Israeli civilians were arrested. The military gave a somewhat different account, saying an Israeli civilian had been attacked and injured by militants near an Israeli settlement. Then, it said “a violent confrontation developed between a number of Israeli civilians and Palestinians,” injuring another Israeli civilian. Masafer Yatta was designated by the Israeli military as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s, and the military has ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usuallyturn a blind eyeor intervene on behalf of the settlers. The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians anddisplaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
"Planned Parenthood St. Louis resumes surgical abortions, while Missouri blocks others",https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-planned-parenthood-st-louis-975a18e93c90ae7037dbd359dd7aac18,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A Missouri and American flag fly outside Planned Parenthood in St. Louis, June 24, 2022. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File) COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Planned Parenthood on Thursday resumed surgicalabortionsin St. Louis, months after voters in Novemberenshrined abortion rightsin the Missouri Constitution. The same day, the state health department effectively blocked medication abortions throughout Missouri. The decision leaves abortion access in Missouri in a confusing state: surgical abortions are legal, but Planned Parenthood still cannot offer medication abortions. Planned Parenthood now offers surgical abortions in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. Planned Parenthood Great Plains in February at a Kansas City area clinic performed thefirst abortion in the statesince thefall of Roe v. Wade.A Columbia clinic restarted abortions earlier this month. The first abortion at the St. Louis center since 2022 occurred Thursday. “We stand ready to welcome more patients to ensure they can get the care they need, when they need it,” Great Rivers President and CEO Margot Riphagen said in a statement. Missouri banned almost all abortions in 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The ban included exceptions in cases of emergencies, but not for rape or incest. Voters in November responded by passing a constitutional amendment protecting reproductive rights. While many believed the amendment would undo the ban, the measure left it up to judges to decide whether the state’s long list of laws and other regulations are now unconstitutional. A lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights advocates to overturn most of the state’s abortion laws is set for trial in January 2026.  Planned Parenthood currently cannot provide medication abortions in Missouri, but affiliates in February submitted complication plans to the state health department in order to begin offering medication abortions. Complication plans detail what clinics will do in case of complications from abortions. On March 13, the Department of Health and Senior Services filed emergency complication plan regulations to “protect Missourians’ access to safe and reliable care,” according to the rule. “The rule will ensure that women can quickly and safely receive proper emergency care for abortion-related complications at a convenient location,” the regulation states. The regulations took effect Thursday. That day, the health department notified Planned Parenthood that its complication plans do not comply with the new rules, without being more specific. A spokesperson for the health department did not immediately return Associated Press requests for comment Friday. Planned Parenthood Great Plains President and CEO Emily Wales said medication abortion is popular among patients, who might want a less-invasive abortion because of past abuse. “We do have patients who’ve contacted us in the last few months who prefer medication abortion and who will choose to travel rather than exercise their right to abortion in Missouri because medication isn’t available to them,” Wales said. GOP Attorney General Andrew Bailey, whose office is defending Missouri’s abortion laws in court, in March ordered Planned Parenthood to not provide medication abortions because the health department has not approved its complication plans. “This cease and desist letter ensures that basic health and safety standards are met,” Bailey said in a statement after issuing the order. “Given Planned Parenthood’s history, I will continue to ensure their compliance with state law.” Planned Parenthood said it has no plans to provide medication abortions without proper permission. “There was nothing to cease and desist,” Wales said. Missouri’s Republican-led Legislature, which passed the near-total ban, is trying again to limit abortions. A House committee next week is scheduled to advance a new constitutional amendment that would impose additional restrictions on abortion, GOP House Speaker Jon Patterson said. Any proposed amendment would need to be approved by voters. It’s unclear exactly how House lawmakers want to further regulation abortions. Patterson said the legislation is currently in negotiations.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil coach Dorival Júnior was fired on Friday after14 monthsamid poor results and disappointing performances from the national team. Júnior’s sacking by Brazilian Football Confederation president Ednaldo Rodrigues came three days after a4-1 defeat to bitter rival Argentinain Buenos Aires, Brazil’s heaviest defeat in a World Cup qualifier. “The confederation announces that Dorival Júnior’s cycle is over,” Rodrigues told media in Rio de Janeiro. “From now on, we will work in the search for a substitute. Much has been said about (the confederation) contacting A, B or C coach, but I should say that (comment) was never coming from this president or anyone that the president authorized.” Brazil is fifth in South American qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. The top six qualify automatically. Under the 62-year-old Júnior, Brazil won seven matches, drew another seven, and lost two. But it has won only one of its last four games. The team scored 25 goals and conceded 17. In the Copa America last year, Brazil was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Uruguay on penalties. Rodrigues was just re-elected on Monday to head the confederation to 2030. In 2023, he bet on Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti to take over one year later. While waiting for Ancelotti, Brazil had under-20 coach Ramon Menezes as an interim then hired Fernando Diniz. Diniz was fired in January 2024 after two wins, one draw and three losses on the job and Ancelotti extended his contract in Spain.  The last time Brazil had three coaches between World Cups was before its latest title in 2002. Luiz Felipe Scolari took the job one year before the tournament in Japan and South Korea. Local media reported that Rodrigues will make another approach to Ancelotti and that Al-Hilal coach Jorge Jesus is also being considered. Either the Italian or the Portuguese coach would become Brazil’s first ever foreign coach if a deal is reached. Brazil’s next two South American qualifying matches are in June at second-placed Ecuador and at home against sixth-placed Paraguay. Ancelotti’s Real Madrid and Jesus’ Al-Hilal are scheduled to play that month in the Club World Cup in the United States. AP soccer:https://apnews.com/hub/soccer   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)             EBERSWALDE, Germany (AP) — A company that specializes in earlywildfiredetection has developed a new, AI-based drone it says will help speed up the detection, location and monitoring of fires. The Silvaguard drone by Dryard Networks was presented Thursday in Eberswalde outside of Berlin as wildfires driven byextreme heatandclimate changeare becoming a more common, oftendeadly phenomenonaround the globe. The drone will deliver infrared images, among other things, and works in combination with a fire detection system that the company developed earlier and that’s already being used in several countries. The fire detection system, called Silvanet, is designed to detect wildfires at the smoldering stage using solar-powered gas sensors connected via a wireless network. Each gas sensor can protect an area the size of a football field and be attached to a tree. The plan is that once Silvanet detects a fire, it will trigger a nearby Silvaguard drone to fly to the location and provide detailed images. “Today we saw a combination of Silvanet — the solar powered gas sensors that detected the fire within minutes — with Silvaguard, the first prototype of an autonomous, an AI enabled drone that we dispatched in response to a fire,” said Carsten Brinkschulte, the CEO and co-founder, Dryad Networks. The drone “flew autonomously to the location of the sensor, detecting the fire, and delivered overhead infrared and optical video from the point of fire,” he said of the newly developed drone.  The company is still waiting to get the go-ahead for the commercial use of Silvaguard drone from authorities. The information about the fire, including geographic coordinates, video and infrared images, will then be sent to the firefighters who will then know where the fire is spreading and how big it is, which will help them know how many firefighters need to be deployed. “When it comes to wildfires, time is of the essence, you cannot be fast enough,” Brinkschulte said.

FACT FOCUS: A look at false and misleading claims made by Trump during his address to Congress,https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-trump-ukraine-3bea1df50167ac0a91f8c419b58c4b97,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

President Donald Trump’s one-hour and 40-minute address to Congress highlighted many of his initiatives, from an immigration crackdown to tariffs and energy policy. ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration President Donald Trump‘sTuesday night addressto a joint session of Congresshighlighted several of the initiativeshe’s started in his first six weeks in office, but many of his comments included false and misleading information. Here’s a look at the facts. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)  TRUMP: “Illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. Ever.” THE FACTS: Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday that Border Patrol apprehended 8,326 people on the U.S.-Mexico border last month. But U.S. government data show that Border Patrol routinely averaged below that number in the 1960s. While February marked the lowest arrest total in decades, Border Patrol averaged less than February 2025 for the first seven years of 1960s. The government website does not track U.S.-Mexico border totals before 1960. Border Patrol’s monthly average was 1,752 arrests in 1961. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  TRUMP: “Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members.” THE FACTS: That figure, which Trump cites regularly, is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 10.8 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through December 2024. But that’s arrests, not people. Under asylum restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests. There is no evidence other countries are sending their criminals or people with mental illness across the border, despite this frequent line from Trump.  President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)  TRUMP: Citing alleged examples of what he described as “appalling waste” in the federal government, referenced ”$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.” THE FACTS: Trump appeared to be referencing a payment of $58.6 million — one of two the cityreceived last month. The payment was a federal reimbursement under the Shelter and Services Program, which was created to support local governments and non-government organizations that provide support to noncitizens released by immigration authorities. Liz Garcia, a city spokesperson, said at the time that these reimbursements included $19 million in claims for hotel costs. The two payments totaled over $80.5 million for services delivered between November 2023 and October 2024. Members of Congress greet President Donald Trump as he arrives to address a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  TRUMP: “Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.” THE FACTS: Trump is banking on the idea that taxing imports is the road to riches for the United States. Most economists say Trump’s tariffswould hurt the country, as they’re tax increases that could raise the costs of goods in ways that could also harm economic growth. Trump suggests that the impact on inflation would be minimal. When the Yale University Budget Lab looked at thetariffs that Trump imposed Tuesdayon Canada, Mexico and China, it found that inflation would increase a full percentage point, growth would fall by half a percentage point and the average household would lose about $1,600 in disposable income. TRUMP: “Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. ... 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them, and we are searching right now.” THE FACTS: The databases may list those people, but that does not mean they are getting paid benefits. Democrats hold signs as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Part of the confusion comes from Social Security’s software system based on the COBOL programming language, which doesn’t use a specific format for dates. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization Wired first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration. Additionally, a series ofreportsfrom the Social Security Administration’s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these people were receiving benefits. The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million. As of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.

Scott Applewhite)  TRUMP: “Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.” THE FACTS: Inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022 under President Joe Biden, but Trump did not inherit a disastrous economy by any measure. The unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4% in January, the month he took office, while the economy expanded a healthy2.8% in 2024. Inflation-adjusted incomes have grown steadily since mid-2023. And inflation, while showing signs of stickiness in recent months and still elevated at3% in January, is down from its 2022 peak. Still, concern about the economy was akey driverbehind support for Trump during the 2024 election. The average price ofbasic consumer goodsin particular has seen major spikes in recent years. A dozen large eggs, for example, went from a low of $1.33 in August 2020 to $4.82 in January 2023. They decreased in price to $2.07 in September 2023, but are currently on the rise again, at $4.95 as of January.

Biden had set up a non-binding goal thatEVs make up half of new cars soldby 2030. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office revoking that goal. Biden’s policies tightened restrictions on pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks in an effort to encourage Americans to buy EVs and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars. TRUMP: “I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years.” THE FACTS: Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Army’s recruiting turnaround is tied to his time in office. In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total coming in August 2024 — before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers. A significant driver of the recruiting success was the Army’s decision to launch theFuture Soldier Prep Courseat Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training.

(AP foto/Morry Gash)             ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin’s Democratic attorney general asked a court on Friday to block billionaireElon Muskfrom handing out $1 million checks to voters this weekend, just days beforethe state’s hotly contested Supreme Court racewas to be decided. Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit in county circuit court to stop Musk from making the payments, which he said he would make Sunday in Wisconsin. Musk initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to “personally hand over” $2 million to a pair of voters who havealready cast their ballotsin the race. Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be “spokesmen” for an online petition against “activist” judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition. Also on Friday, Musk’s political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway — a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for President Donald Trump and his agenda. Musk deleted the post about the Sunday giveaway from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.  He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday in Green Bay, just two days before the election that will determine ideological control of the court in the battleground state. “I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,” Musk’s now deleted post said. “This is super important.” Kaul asked the court to order that Musk stop promoting the Sunday giveaway and not make any future payments to Wisconsin voters. Kaul referenced the changing plans for the Sunday event in arguing that any payment to voters was a violation of state law. Even though the original post was deleted, there has been no announcement that the payments will not be made, Kaul argued in the lawsuit. After a campaign stop in Beaver Dam, in south central Wisconsin, Schimel declined to say whether or not he thought Musk’s proposal was illegal, or whether Kaul’s move was appropriate. “I don’t know. I’m not his lawyer,” Schimel said of Musk after the event in a strip mall parking lot. As for Kaul’s lawsuit, he said: “I don’t care what he does. That’s his business. I’m running for Wisconsin Supreme Court. I don’t get involved in those legal battles. And I don’t give legal advice.” Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk’s PAC that planned to host the event, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Supreme Court race, with spending above $81 million, has shattered previous records for a U.S. judicial election, and has becomea referendum on Musk and the first monthsof Trump’s administration. Trump endorsed Brad Schimel, a fellow Republican, and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night. “It’s a very important race,” Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel’s campaign. “I know you feel it’s local, but it’s not. It’s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.” Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday’s election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play. Kaul’s lawsuit was initially randomly assigned to Crawford but reassigned to another judge in neighboring Columbia County within minutes. Musk’s PAC said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against “activist” judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and “get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.” “If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,” Ainsworth said in the video. Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel’s campaign this year, campaign finance records show. He has also made dozens of Facebook posts since January supporting Schimel, including photos from campaign events, local organizations’ endorsements of Schimel and X posts from Trump urging Wisconsinites to vote for Schimel. Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did. That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law, which makes it a felony to offer, give, lend, or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote. Musk changing the terms of his offer may mitigate the circumstances, but it doesn’t necessarily resolve the legal issue, said Bryna Godar, staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. “The question is whether the offers are ‘in order to induce’ people to vote or go to the polls, and there can be arguments made on either side of that question,” she said in an email. Any legal challenge to Musk’s payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV. “I, frankly, thought, ‘Should I sign that petition? I’m against activist judges, but I don’t think I should do that,’” Schimel said. When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, “I don’t know what the criteria to get it was.” Crawford’s campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk’s announced visit to Wisconsin a “last-minute desperate distraction.” “Wisconsinites don’t want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk’s lackey Brad Schimel,” he said. Musk’s political action committee useda nearly identical tacticbefore the White House election last year,offering to pay$1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutorsfailed to showthe effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day. Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million. The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to rule onabortion rights,congressional redistricting,union powerand voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.

"Wall Street tumbles, and S&P 500 drops 2% on worries about slower economy and higher inflation",https://apnews.com/article/market-rates-trump-tariffs-91a5088aa36966aaf5e0971147a66930,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Another wipeout walloped Wall Street Friday. Worries are building about a potentiallytoxic mixofworsening inflationand a U.S. economy slowing because ofhouseholds afraidto spend due to theglobal trade war. The S&P 500 dropped 2% for one of its worst days in the last two years. It thudded to itsfifth losing weekin thelast sixafter wiping out what had beena big gain to start the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 715 points, or 1.7%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.7%. Lululemon Athletica led the market lower with a drop of 14.2%, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year, in part because “consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,” said CEO Calvin McDonald. Inflation news send stocks lower. Here’s AP business correspondent Seth Sutel. Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 5.7%. CEO Tom Chubb said it saw a “deterioration in consumer sentiment that also weighed on demand” beginning in January, which accelerated into February. They’re discouraging data points when one of the mainworries hitting Wall Streetis thatPresident Donald Trump’sescalatingtariffsmay cause U.S. households and businesses tofreeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurtthe economy.  A report on Friday showed all types of U.S. consumers are getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. That’s the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that’s been alinchpinkeeping the U.S. economy solid. A separate report also raised concerns after it showed a widely followed, underlying measure of inflation was a touch worse last month than economists expected. It followed reports on other measures of inflation for February, but this is the one the Federal Reserve pays the most attention to as it decides what to do with interest rates. The report also showed that an underlying measure of how much income Americans are making, which excludes government social benefits and some other items, “has been treading water for the last three months,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Households aren’t in a good place to absorb a little tariff pain,” he said. “The Fed isn’t likely to run to the rescue either as inflation moved up more than expected in February.” The Fed could return to cutting interest rates, like it was doing late last year, in order to give the economy and financial markets a boost. But such cuts would also push upward on inflation, which has been sticking above the Fed’s 2% target. The economy and job market have been holding up so far, but if they were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called “stagflation.” Policy makers in Washington have few good tools to fix it. Some of Wall Street’s sharpest losses on Friday hit companies that need customers feeling confident enough to spend, and not just on yoga wear or beach clothes. Delta Air Lines lost 5%. Casino operator Caesars Entertainment dropped 5%. Domino’s Pizza sank 5.1%. The heaviest weights on the market were Apple, Microsoft and other Big Tech stocks, whose massive sizes give their movements more sway over indexes. They and other stocks that had gotten caught up in the frenzy aroundartificial-intelligencetechnology have been among the hardest hit in Wall Street’s recent sell-off. Their prices had shot up so much more quickly than their already fast-growing revenues and profits that critics said they looked too expensive. CoreWeave, whose cloud platform helps customers manage complex AI infrastructure, was flat in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq. On the flip side, among the relatively few rising stocks on Wall Street were those that can make money almost regardless of what the economy does, such as utilities. American Water Works rose 2.2%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 112.37 points to 5,580.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 715.80 to 41,583.90, and the Nasdaq composite lost 481.04 to 17,322.99. Stock markets worldwide will likely remain shaky as an April 2 deadline approaches for more tariffs. That’s what Trump has called “Liberation Day,” when he will roll out tariffs tailored to each of the United States’ trading partners. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell sharply in Japan and South Korea as automakers felt more pressure following Trump’s announcement that he plans to impose 25% tariffs onauto imports. Hyundai Motor fell 2.6% in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6%, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8% in Tokyo. Thailand’s SET lost 1% after apowerful earthquakecentered in Myanmar rattled the region, causing the prime minister to declare a state of emergency for the capital, Bangkok. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 4.25% from 4.38% late Thursday. It tends to fall when expectations for either U.S. economic growth or inflation are on the wane.

(AP Photo/Gerard Carreon)       WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s younger brother is serving in a key position inside the Pentagon as a Department of Homeland Security liaison and senior adviser, Hegseth’s office confirmed. The high-profile job has meant meetings with a UFC fighting champion, a trip to Guantanamo Bay and, right now,traveling on the Pentagon’s 747aircraft as Hegseth makes his first trip as defense secretary to the Indo-Pacific. Phil Hegseth’s official title is senior adviser to the secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and liaison officer to the Defense Department, spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson said in a statement Thursday. “Phil Hegseth, one of a number of talented DHS liaisons to DOD, is conducting touch points with U.S. Coast Guard officials on the Secretary’s Indo-Pacific trip,” which includes stops in Hawaii, Guam, the Philippines and Japan, Wilson said in response to a query by The Associated Press. Border security, the responsibility of DHS, has been highlighted as one of the top priorities for President Donald Trump, and thousands of U.S. troops have been deployed to the border to assist DHS with curbing illegal immigration.  It’s common for the Defense Department and other federal agencies to have liaisons. Each military branch sends liaisons to Capitol Hill. The Pentagon, State Department and others all use interagency liaisons to more closely coordinate and keep tabs on policy. But it is not common for those senior-level positions to be filled by family members of the Cabinet heads, said Michael Fallings, a managing partner at Tully Rinckey PLLC, which specializes in federal employment law. Based on Phil Hegseth’s publicly available resume, his past experience includes founding his own podcast production company, Embassy and Third, and working on social media and podcasts atThe Hudson Institute. It’s not the first time Phil Hegseth has worked alongside his older brother. WhenPete Hegsethwas CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, a nonprofit that fell into financial difficulty during his time there, he paid his brother $108,000 to do media relations for the organization, according to federal tax records. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Phil Hegseth’s job title and said this “interagency mission is part of Mr. Hegseth’s preview,” presumably meaning “purview.” DHS said Phil Hegseth, while on the Indo-Pacific trip, has been meeting with representatives from Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of the department, “and other DHS components and interagency partners.” The Pentagon did not respond to a request to interview Phil Hegseth. Neither the Pentagon nor the Department of Homeland Security has responded to queries about his qualifications for the job.. He has been his brother’s close ally, appearing alongside him throughout his fraught confirmation process in the Senate. In photos, as Pete Hegseth walked the halls of Congress, Phil Hegseth is often right there by his side. He now has offices just down the hall from him along the Pentagon’s E-Ring, according to a U.S. official familiar with the office location, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Photos posted by the defense secretary’s official Flickr account show Phil Hegseth at the secretary’s table as he met with officials or high-profile guests, including Ultimate Fighting Championship champion Conor McGregor this month. He traveled to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with Pete Hegseth in February. A 1967 federal nepotism law prohibits government officials from hiring, promoting or recommending relatives to any civilian position over which they exercise control. An image of an office organizational chart obtained by The Associated Press shows Phil Hegseth in a small group of officials directly beneath his brother, with Phil Hegseth labeled as a senior adviser to the defense secretary. Further review of Phil Hegseth’s hiring would be needed to determine if it ran afoul of federal nepotism laws, “but it does not pass the smell test,” Fallings said. However, if he is wholly employed by DHS, that “would avoid a nepotism violation, unless it can be shown that (Pete) Hegseth was involved in the hiring or had asserted his authority to help hire his brother.” DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it wholly employs Phil Hegseth, whether he is paid and if so at what federal pay level. There are also some exceptions to the nepotism law for the president’s office. In his first term, Trump appointed his son-in-law Jared Kushner to serve as his senior adviser. When he was president, Bill Clinton named first lady Hillary Clinton to serve on his health care task force. In the Biden administration, Jake Sullivan served as national security adviser to the president while his brother, Tom Sullivan, was the counselor of the State Department.

A mob in southern Nigeria kills 16 people they suspected of being kidnappers,https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-mob-killings-764c183e27d5f2c46d51ba0d14f2c590,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — A mob in southern Nigeria killed 16 people, at least some them when tires were forced over their heads and shoulders and set on fire because they were believed to be kidnappers, officials said Friday. The victims from the country’s north were killed in the Uromi area of Edo State after being stopped by local security personnel. During a search of their vehicle, officers discovered locally made weapons and that triggered the attack by the mob, Edo police spokesperson Moses Yamu said in a statement. Videos shared on social media showed the victims being brutalized before they were eventually set on fire with worn-out vehicle tires. Mob violence in Nigeria has surged over the past decade. While attacks in the south are often linked to accusations of theft and witchcraft, the north has seen a rise in mob attacks over alleged blasphemy, according to a 2024 Amnesty International report. In 2022, SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based research group, said there have been at least 391 mob killings in Africa’s most populous country since 2019. Ten from the group of travelers were rescued from the Thursday attack, which also left two people hospitalized with injuries, Yamu said. The police spokesperson said 14 suspects were arrested in connection with the attack. On a visit to the scene, Edo state Gov. Monday Okpebholo said the perpetrators would face the full wrath of the law.  “Nobody has the right to take another man’s life,” Solomon Osaghale, a representative of the governor, said in a statement. The attack sparked outrage on social media, with politicians from the north condemning the killings. In 2012, four students from the University of Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State and one of Nigeria’s oil producing areas, were lynched after they were wrongly suspected of being armed robbers. At the time, the attacks sparked nationwide outrage, igniting protests and debates about the country’s judicial system. Many believe the victims never received justice.

(AP Photo/Javier Arciga)        ATLANTA (AP) — Black women around the world gather in salons, dorm rooms and living rooms for hours at a time to get synthetic braids put in their hair. But they’re wondering if the convenience and fashion benefits are being outweighed bypotential health hazards. The question circulating on social media and in the Black community follows on the heels of a proposed federal rule — that’s still in limbo after multiple delays — to ban thecarcinogen formaldehydein hair-straightening chemicals. There’s a thin body of research into the potential issues of using synthetic hair for braids. The latest addition is an independent study from Consumer Reports into chemicals found in braiding products. Some say the findings are concerning, but others are hesitant to make recommendations in part because the methodology did not go through a typical study review process. All of the experts who spoke with The Associated Press did agree more research is needed into synthetic braids and other products Black women often use in or on their hair. Here’s a look at what’s known, what’s not known and what you might want to do in the meantime. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on using synthetic hair for braiding.  Experts say it’s difficult to draw conclusions from prior studies. The Consumer Reports study, which was published in late February, said there were dangerous chemicals like lead, benzene and other carcinogens in 10 of the most popular synthetic braiding products. While experts said the presence of the chemicals is concerning and confusing, they noted the study didn’t go through the rigorous scrutiny that it takes to get published in a peer-reviewed science or medical journal. Javon Ford, a cosmetic chemist who talks about his work on social media, questioned the report’s findings, saying “the data set is so limited.” Consumer Reports only sampled two of each product, despite thousands on the market. James Rogers, the head of product safety at Consumer Reports who led the study, said his hope was to get the information out there because of the lack of research. He noted that it was a pilot project, but that “we thought the results were important enough to start the conversation.” Research published in 2020 in the journal Environmental Health Insights showed synthetic hair let off volatile organic compounds — chemicals that can easily evaporate into the air — when heated. Synthetic hair is sealed when braided, either by burning it or dipping it in hot water. That study detected many of the same chemicals named in the Consumer Reports study, like the known carcinogen benzene. Experts can’t answer whether the products are truly safe — but that’s because there’s so little research out there. There’s also little government oversight on the products, which leaves manufacturers to ensure that they’re safe. Consumer Reports is petitioning the Food and Drug Administration to begin regulating synthetic braiding hair. Jasmine McDonald, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who has studied the health impacts of chemical hair straighteners, said the Consumer Reports study shouldn’t invoke fear but awareness about the potential harms of braiding hair, the lack of federal regulations and the minimal research. “I think that in our culture, we sometimes normalize things to the point where we don’t see the harm ... the more that we can raise awareness that some of these cultural routines could potentially provide harm is us having the potential to stop that harm,” McDonald said. If you’re concerned about using synthetic braiding hair or straightening chemicals, there are other hairstyles to try. You can use Brazilian wool hair instead of synthetic hair, said Gloria Okpurukre, who owns Anointed Fingers braiding salon in Fayetteville, Georgia. You can also braid your real hair, but don’t expect the same results. “The purpose of adding the hair is for volume and length,” Okpurukre said. “A lot of people, their hair starts thinning out and they need to add something to make it look nice.” Some synthetic brands use banana fiber to create the hair, which companies say are less irritating to the scalp. But Ford said you won’t necessarily avoid chemicals just because you switch brands. Raven Baxter, a molecular biologist who has talked about braiding hair on social media, opted to stop using synthetic braiding products because of the lack of information — both on the packaging or in research studies. Now, she uses single-ingredient products in her hair care routine, like aloe vera gel and vegetable glycerin. “A lot of the work that scientists do, we’re able to do it because a funder deemed it as important to support that research,” she said, adding, “until we have funders that value the things that we’re concerned about, we’re not necessarily going to get the research published that concerns us.” McDonald suggested staying away from products that contain PFAS, parabens and other “forever chemicals.” She also said consumers can determine what’s in the products and their relative safety by looking at online databases, like the Breast Cancer Prevention Partners’ Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.

All Rights Reserved. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem arrives at the Felipe Angeles International Airport (AIFA) in Zumpango on the outskirts of Mexico City, Friday, March 28, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S. Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemlanded in Mexico on Friday to cap off a tour to three Latin American nations to discuss immigration, crime and deportation. Noem’s first visit to the region comes as it gains increasing importance to the Trump administration, which is attempting to scale up deportation efforts and warn against migration north. As Noem visited El Salvador and Colombia, Secretary of State Marco Rubiovisited Guyanato meet with a number of Caribbean leaders. After being greeted at the airport by Mexico’s foreign minister, Noem met with Mexican PresidentClaudia Sheinbaumand other top Mexican officials. The two leaders were photographed sitting next to each other in a meeting room along with other aids and together in front of American and Mexican flags. Sheinbaum’s government has been working to offsettariffs lodged by the Trump administration, which economic forecasters say could thrust the Mexican economy into a recession. In exchange for delaying sanctions in past months, the Mexican government sent 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and reported sharp crackdowns on drug labs. It also sent 29 top cartel figures long sought by the American government to the U.S. to face justice. After the meeting on Friday, Noem wrote on a post on the social media platform on X that the moves were “a positive step.” “But there is still much work to be done to stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into our country,” she added.  Sheinbaum, meanwhile, called the meeting “fruitful” and said Mexico and the U.S. “maintain a good relationship within a framework of respect for each other’s sovereignty.” Despite25% tariffs on auto partsannounced by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this week, Sheinbaum said ahead of the meeting that the focus of her conversation with Noem would largely be about security and migration, adding that she would emphasize Mexico’s sovereignty in the meeting. “More that informing, we’re going to share with her what is being done and also the coordination and collaboration that has been established with the United States,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing. “It is going to be a cordial meeting on coordination.” While other leaders have taken a more confrontational approach with Trump and imposed reciprocal tariffs, Sheinbaum has walked a fine line with the Republican U.S. president, and the government has taken a collaborative approach to offset the economic blow. On Wednesday, Sheinbaum said Mexico would seek “preferential treatment” to Trump’s auto tariffs. Sheinbaum’s managing of the relationship with Trump has been met by soaring approval in Mexico. ___   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)     Arctic sea ice had its weakest winter buildup since record-keeping began 47 years ago, a symptom of climate change that will have repercussions globally, scientists said Thursday. The Arctic reaches its maximum sea ice in March each year and then starts a six-month melt season. The National Snow and Ice Data Center said the peak measurement taken Saturday was 5.53 million square miles (14.33 million square kilometers) — about 30,000 square miles (80,000 square kilometers) smaller than the lowest previous peak in 2017. That’s a difference about the size of California. “Warming temperaturesare what’s causing the ice to decline,’' ice data scientist Walt Meier said. “You know, sea ice in particular is very sensitive... 31 degrees is ice skating and 33 degrees it’s swimming.” Jennifer Francis, a scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, said this is yet another ringing alarm bell in the form of a broken record. “Disappearing sea ice is a particularly worrisome story because it’s truly an early warning system alerting us about a variety of hard-to-see changes,” Francis said in an email. Scientists said warming conditions in the Arctic — the region is warming four times faster than the rest of the world — affect weather elsewhere. Pressure and temperature differences between north and south shrink. Thatweakens the jet stream, that moves weather systems along, making it dip further south with cold outbreaks and storms that oftenget stuck and rain or snow more, according to the snow and ice center and Francis.  “The warming winter atmosphere above the Arctic Circle does impact large-scale weather patterns that do influence for those of us outside the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist at the University of Manitoba. Of the smaller sea ice, Stroeve also noted that it’s not only that there’s less of it. The remaining ice is thin enough for more of it to melt quickly this summer, Stroeve said. She cautioned that a record low area in the winter doesn’t guarantee a record small area in the summer. Melting Arctic sea ice — mostly in the summer — ismaking the polar bear population smaller, weaker and hungrierbecause they rely on the sea ice to hunt from, scientists said. And winter sea ice is especially important for fisheries and seal pups, Meier said. Arctic sea ice’s biggest year since record-keeping began was 1979, at 6.42 million square miles (16.64 million square kilometers). That means since satellites began tracking it, Arctic sea ice’s winter peak has shrunk by about the size of Pakistan. When winter sea ice is doing well it can extend more than halfway down the Earth toward the equator, reach Japan, China and Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence, Meier said. Meier said sea ice extent is shrinking all four seasons, but the most important season for the overall health of the Arctic ice is the summer. That’s because ice-free waters warm up quicker, hold more energy and make fall and winter warmer and weaker. The five lowest amounts for winter peak Arctic sea ice have been since 2015. Earlier this month, Antarctica came close to breaking a record for record low sea ice — this is the time of year the region hits its minimum — and ended up with the second-lowest sea level on record. There’s more sea ice in the Antarctic in general and the two poles are timed a bit differently, but in February, global sea ice — the combination of Arctic and Antarctic — hit a record low, Meier said.

(Thomas Traasdahl/Ritzau Scanpix via AP, file)       NUUK, Greenland (AP) — The remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, which Vice President JD Vance isvisiting on Friday, is the U.S. Department of Defense’s northernmost installation. The base was built following a 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. It supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. The Pituffik base is located on the northwestern coast of Greenland, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) north of the the Arctic Circle and 1,524 kilometers (947 miles) south of the North Pole. It is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) north of Greenland’s capital, Nuuk. It was known as the Thule Air Base until 2023, when it was renamed to recognize Greenlandic cultural heritage and reflect its role in the relatively new U.S. Space Force. The base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, but its airfield remains open all year round. It is in constant darkness from November to February and constant daylight from May to August. It is operated by the 821st Space Base Group and is also home to the world’s northernmost deepwater sea port. The nearest town is Qaanaaq, around 120 kilometers (75 miles) to the northwest.

"Convicted of bilking investors, Nikola founder and Trump donor gets a presidential pardon",https://apnews.com/article/nikola-trevor-milton-fraud-trump-pardon-3fcebb0a3820cecb205656f2dc3f6764,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Trevor Milton, left, leaves the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse on Monday, Sept. 12, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Brittainy Newman, File) Trevor Milton, the founder of electric vehicle start-up Nikola who wassentenced to prison last year for fraud, was pardoned by President Donald Trump, the White House confirmed Friday. The pardon of Milton, who was sentenced to four years in prison for exaggerating the potential of his technology, could wipe out hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution that prosecutors were seeking for defrauded investors. Milton, 42, and his wife donated more than $1.8 million to a Trump re-election campaign fund less than a month before the November election, according to the Federal Election Commission. At Milton’s trial, prosecutors say a company video of a prototype truck appearing to be driven down a desert highway was actually a video of a nonfunctioning Nikola that had been rolled down a hill. Milton had not been incarcerated pending an appeal. Milton said late Thursday on social media that he had been pardoned by Trump. “I am incredibly grateful to President Trump for his courage in standing up for what is right and for granting me this sacred pardon of innocence,” Milton said. The White House confirmed the pardon Friday, though there was no notice of a pardon on the White House website. When asked by a reporter in a news conference Friday why he pardoned Milton, Trump said it was “highly recommended by many people.” Trump suggested that Milton was prosecuted because he supported the president.  “They say the the thing that he did wrong was he was one of the first people that supported a gentleman named Donald Trump for president,” Trump said. Trump went on to say that Milton “did nothing wrong” and that the Southern District of New York’s prosecutors were “a vicious group of people.” During his securities fraud case, Milton was defended by two lawyers with connections to Trump: Marc Mukasey, who has represented the Trump Organization; and Brad Bondi, the brother of Pam Bondi, who Trump appointed as U.S. Attorney General. Also Friday, Trump commuted the sentence of Ozy Media co-founder Carlos Watson, just before he was due to report to prison for a nearly 10-year sentence in a financial conspiracy case. Trump has wasted little time in using his pardon power since beginning his second term. Hours after taking office, he wiped clean the records of roughly 1,500 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. The next day, Trump announced that he hadpardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, an underground website for selling drugs. Ulbricht had beensentenced to life in prisonin 2015 after a high-profile prosecution that highlighted the role of the internet in illegal markets. Nikola, which was a hot start-up and rising star on Wall Street before becomingenmeshed in scandal, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February. Milton, convicted of fraud, was portrayed by prosecutors as a con man six years after he had founded the company in a basement in Utah. Prosecutors said Milton falsely claimed to have built its own revolutionary truck that was actually a General Motors product with Nikola’s logo stamped onto it. Called as a government witness,Nikola’s CEO testifiedthat Milton “was prone to exaggeration” when pitching his venture to investors. Milton resigned in 2020 amid reports of fraud that sent Nikola’s stock prices into a tailspin. Investors suffered heavy losses as reports questioned Milton’s claims that the company had already produced zero-emission 18-wheel trucks. The company paid $125 million in 2021 tosettlea civil case against it by the SEC. Nikola didn’t admit any wrongdoing. The U.S. District Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment on Milton’s pardon. At the time of his conviction U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, “Trevor Milton lied to investors again and again — on social media, on television, on podcasts, and in print. But today’s sentence should be a warning to start-up founders and corporate executives everywhere — ‘fake it till you make it’ is not an excuse for fraud, and if you mislead your investors, you will pay a stiff price.” The White House said Trump also pardoned on Thursday cryptocurrency entrepreneurs Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed. The three men founded and help run the cryptocurrency exchange BITMEX, which was ordered to pay a $100 million fine earlier this year after prosecutors said it “willfully flouted U.S. anti-money laundering laws to boost revenue.” Hayes, Delo and Reed pleaded guilty in 2022 to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and were sentenced to probation.

(AP Photo/John Hanna)           TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The leader of a small group of self-described satanists and at least one other person were arrested Friday following a scuffle inside the Kansas Statehouse arising from an effort by the group’s leader to start a “Black Mass” in the rotunda. About 30 members of the Kansas City-area Satanic Grotto, led by its president, Michael Stewart, rallied outside the Statehouse for the separation of church and state. The group also protested what members called the state’s favoritism toward Christians in allowing events inside. Gov. Laura Kelly temporarily banned protests inside, just for Friday, weeks after Stewart’s group scheduled its indoor ceremony. The Satanic Grotto’s rally outside drew hundreds of Christian counterprotesters because of the Grotto’s satanic imagery, and its indoor ceremony included denouncing Jesus Christ, who Christians believe is the Son of God. About 100 Christians stood against yellow police tape marking the Satanic Grotto’s area. The two groups yelled at each other while the Christians also sang and called on Grotto members to accept Jesus. Several hundred more Christians rallied on the other side of the Grotto’s area, but further away. Kelly issued her order earlier this month after Roman Catholic groups pushed her to ban any Satanic Grotto event. The state’s Catholic Bishops called what the group planned “a despicable act of anti-Catholic bigotry” mocking the Catholic Mass. Both chambers of the Legislature also approved resolutions condemning it. “The Bible says Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy, so when we dedicate a state to Satan, we’re dedicating it to death,” said Jeremiah Hicks, a pastor at the Cure Church in Kansas City, Kansas.  Satanic Grotto members, who number several dozen, said they hold a variety of beliefs. Some are atheists, some use the group to protest harm they suffered as church members, and others see Satan as a symbol of independence. Amy Dorsey, a friend of Stewart’s, said she rallied with the Satanic Grotto to support free speech rights and religious freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, in part because Christian groups are allowed to meet regularly inside the Statehouse for prayer or worship meetings. Before his arrest, Stewart said his group scheduled its Black Mass for Friday because it thought the Kansas Legislature would be in session, though lawmakers adjourned late Thursday night for their annual spring break. Stewart said the group might come back next year. “Maybe un-baptisms, right here in the Capitol,” he said. Video shot by KSNT-TV showed that when Stewart tried to conduct his group’s ceremony in the first-floor rotunda, a young man tried to snatch Stewart’s script from his hands, and Stewart punched him. Several Kansas Highway Patrol troopers wrestled Stewart to the ground and handcuffed him. They led him through hallways on the ground floor below and into a room as he yelled, “Hail, Satan!” Stewart’s wife, Maenad Bee, told reporters, “He’s only exercising his First Amendment rights.” Online records showed that Stewart was jailed briefly Friday afternoon on suspicion of disorderly conduct and having an unlawful assembly, then released on $1,000 bond. Witnesses and friends identified the young man trying to snatch away the script as Marcus Schroeder, who came to counterprotest with fellow members of a Kansas City-area church. Online records show Schroeder was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct, with his bond also set at $1,000. Dorsey said two other Satanic Grotto members also were detained, but didn’t have details. The Highway Patrol did not immediately confirm any arrests or detentions. A friend of Schroeder’s, Jonathan Storms, said he was trying to help a woman who also sought to snatch away Stewart’s script and “didn’t throw any punches.” The woman, Karla Delgado, said she came to the Statehouse with her three youngest children to deliver a petition protesting the Black Mass to Kelly’s office. Delgado said she approached Stewart because he was violating the governor’s order and Highway Patrol troopers weren’t immediately arresting him. She said in the ensuing confusion, her 4-year-old daughter was knocked to the ground. “When we saw that nobody was doing anything — I guess just in the moment of it — it was like, ‘He’s not supposed to be allowed to do this,’ so we tried to stop him,” she said.

Is Elon Musk skirting election law in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race?,https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-petition-million-dollars-law-3501e3c50d6c55e585d67da6b5513208,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Elon Musk attends the finals at the NCAA wrestling championship, Saturday, March 22, 2025, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Billionaire Elon Musk’s unprecedented efforts to bolster the conservative candidate in next week’s hotly contestedWisconsin Supreme Court raceran into legal hot water Friday amid accusations that he had broken state election law. Musk announced late Thursday that he planned to hold a Sunday rally in Wisconsin, where he said he would “personally hand over” $1 million checks to two voters who hadalready cast their ballots“in appreciation for you taking the time to vote.” Wisconsin state law expressly prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for voting — drawing a slew of complaints, including from Wisconsin’s Democratic attorney, whosued Friday afternoonto block Musk from handing out the checks. Amid the backlash, Musk deleted the post and later posted a revised offer. “To clarify a previous post, entrance is limited to those who have signed the petition in opposition to activist judges. I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition,” he wrote. Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk’s political action committee, declined to comment on what had prompted the change.  Musk’s initial post drew a flurry of accusations just days before Tuesday’s election, which will determine the ideological makeup of the highest court in the perennial presidential battleground. Attorney General Josh Kaul on Friday asked the circuit court to issue an emergency injunction to stop Musk from making the payments, calling them a “blatant attempt to violate” Wisconsin’s anti-bribery statute. They also took issue with Musk’s political action committee, America First, offering topay $100 to any registered Wisconsin voterwho signed a petition voicing opposition to “activist judges” — or forwarded it to someone who did. Earlier this week,the group announcedthat it hadawarded $1 million to a Green Bay manto serve as a “spokesperson for signing our Petition In Opposition To Activist Judges.” The recipient, Scott Ainsworth, has donated to Republicans and made social media posts supporting President Donald Trump and his agenda. A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former officeholders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and $100 signing payments. Wisconsin law makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote. Numerous legal experts argued Friday that Musk’s first post promising payments to voters for voting appeared to be in clear violation of the bribery statute. “You cannot pay people to vote or not to vote,” said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former White House ethics chief in the Bush administration. “His running these lotteries based on whether people vote or not, it’s illegal. And he’s got to cut that out.” Musk’s revised X post, Painter said, “at least purports to comply with Wisconsin law.” “I guess that technically complies,” he said. Others weren’t so sure. Bryna Godar, staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said Musk changing the terms of his offer “puts the payments and attendance at the rally back into a gray area under Wisconsin law.” “The question is whether the offers are ‘in order to induce’ people to vote or go to the polls, and there can be arguments made on either side of that question,” she said in an email. She also said it is possible that Musk violated the election bribery law simply by offering the payments, even if no money is ever paid. “Given that he already made the offer and that it was up while early voting was actively underway, there is a question of whether the initial post already violated state law, even though he has later walked it back,” she wrote. “Deleting his post and changing the terms might mitigate the circumstances, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal issue.” Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler was more blunt. “Let’s be very clear: Elon Musk committed a crime the moment he offered million-dollar checks ‘in appreciation for’ voting, and deleting evidence of that crime changes nothing,” he said in a statement. “Under Wisconsin law, merely the offer of something of value — in this case, the chance to receive one million dollars — is plainly illegal.” A challenge to Musk’s payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Musk’s political action committee usednearly identical tacticsto the ones he is using in Wisconsin ahead of the presidential election last year, when he spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping President Donald Trump win a second term. That includedoffering to pay$1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Philadelphia’s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutorsfailed to showthe effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day. Rick Hasen, a prominent election law expert at the UCLA School of Law, noted that the legal issues raised this week echoed concerns about Musk’s tactics ahead of last year’s presidential election. “During the 2024 elections, there wasa question whether Elon Musk was breaking federal lawin offering various incentives only to registered voters, including what was essentially a lottery open only to registered voters,”he wrote. “He’s up to similar gimmicks in the upcoming, very expensive Wisconsin Supreme Court race.” According to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice, America PAC and Building for America’s Future, two groups that Musk funds, have spent more than $20 million trying to help elect conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, whom Trump endorsed last week. Schimel is facing Democratic-backed Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford in the race that will determine the ideological makeup of the state’s highest court. Liberals currently have a 4-3 majority. Musk also has given the Wisconsin Republican Party $3 million, which can be passed along to Schimel’s campaign. That outside cash has made the race the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, by far. More than $81 million has been spent to date, obliterating the $51 million record set just two years ago, when another seat on the same court was up for grabs. The election will determine control of the court, but has also becomea referendumon Trump’s first weeks in office — as well as one on Musk himself. During a telephone town hall for Schimel Thursday night, Trump implored his voters to turn out in the off-year election. “It’s a very important race,” he said. “I know you feel it’s local, but it’s not. It’s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.” Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state, whichcould eventuallyend up before the justices. The Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to soon rule on a number of prominent national issues, includingabortion rights,congressional redistrictingand voting rules, which could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, a good government group, said that regardless of the outcome, Musk’s efforts were “unprecedented” in the state. “It’s obscene and unprecedented. He’s already put in close to $20 million,” he said. “This election for a Supreme Court open seat in Wisconsin is going to cost, when it’s all said and done, somewhere between $80 and $100 million dollars. And this is to influence less than four million eligible voters, of which only 25-30% will turn out because this is a spring, low-turnout election.” Colvin reported from New York.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)                DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump’s 25% tax on imported cars, light trucks and auto parts is likely to drive up prices at a time when many Americans already struggle to afford a new set of wheels. The tariffs will also force car companies to rethink what cars they make and where they make them.  Trump has been itching to tax foreign autos for years. In his first term, he declared auto imports a threat to national security, which gave him the authority to impose tariffs on them. On Wednesday, he went ahead and imposed the levies. They take effect midnight April 3. New vehicles are seen at an auto-processing facility at the Atlantic Terminal of the Port of Baltimore, Thursday, March 27, 2025, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)   It’s the latest in a number of auto industry maneuvers by Trump during his first weeks back in the White House. Auto companies are also navigatingthe reversal of fuel economy standards, dialeddown greenhouse gas emission standardsand ahost of electric vehicle policy rollbacks.  Some of the details of Trump’s auto tariffs have yet to be worked out.  For example, it’s unclear whether the new auto tariffs would stack on top of 25% import taxes set to be levied next week on all goods from Canada and Mexico. That would mean cars from Canada and Mexico could potentially face new tariffs of 50%.  And for now, the Trump administration is exempting from the tariffs cars, light trucks and auto parts that qualify for duty-free treatment under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a regional trade pact the president negotiated five years ago. Trump intends to narrow that exemption to content made in the United States, not Canada or Mexico. But that will require setting up processes to determine what qualifies as U.S.-made — something that could take weeks or months.  The White House also said the import tax would apply to “key’’ auto parts, including engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components. And it could expand the tariffs to other auto parts “if necessary.’’  Here’s what else to know:    An aerial view shows auto dealerships in Cerritos, Calif., Thursday, March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)   As automakers expanded globally, they created complicated and efficient supply chains that spanned countries. In North America, for instance, Mexico supplies low-wage labor and makes smaller, less expensive cars and trucks while Canada and the United States provide more skilled labor and technological know-how.  Trump’s tariffs are intended to bring auto manufacturing back to the United States. But it won’t be easy.  Rerouting the sourcing of thousands of parts that are imported to the U.S. and uprooting assembly operations would take years.  “It adds to the uncertainty facing all automakers as the industry’s supply chain is inherently global and has optimized around moving components across national borders where free trade agreements have existed in the past,” said John Paul MacDuffie, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania.  Sam Fiorani, analyst at AutoForecast Solutions, notes that while European makers of luxury vehicles and their buyers can afford some price adjustments, “it’s the companies like Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru who import large percentages of their fleets that will take a beating.”  “Throwing tariffs on the parts of vehicles built in Mexico and Canada that aren’t sourced from the United States will hurt the profits of General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford over the next few quarters, costing them billions,” he added. Two people shop at a Toyota dealership in El Monte, Calif., Thursday, March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)   Trump’s tariffs — which he insists are permanent — will force companies to make hard choices.  “It’s going to have the effect of forcing companies to increase U.S. content’’ if they want to dodge the import taxes, said Richard Mojica, a trade attorney with Miller & Chevalier.  And even though Vanessa Miller, chair of the automotive team at the law firm Foley & Lardner, acknowledges that some companies will be able to pivot operations to the U.S., others are too tied to factories in Mexico or elsewhere to make the move anytime soon.   President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, March 26, 2025. (Pool via AP)   Automakers might have to stop making some vehicles because they won’t be profitable with the tariffs in place. The tariffs hit “everyone in a manner that makes them rethink everything,’’ said Ivan Drury of the automotive website Edmunds. “This is around at least three or four years. We’re not looking at something you can just ride out.’’    Beata Caranci and Andrew Foran of TD Economics estimate that the tariffs could raise the average price of cars and light trucks in the United States — which totaled more than $47,000 last month — by up to $5,000 if automakers pass along the entire cost to consumers. That price hike could go higher – to as much as $10,000 – if the Trump administration applies the tax full to cars made in Mexico and Canada.  Automakers and their suppliers are only now recovering fromyears of instabilitybrought on by pandemic-forced production halts, asweeping semiconductor shortageand low inventory on dealership lots. That meantprices were sky-high, incentives were low and few deals were to be had.  During the peak of the pandemic, consumers still bought vehicles at high prices. But the piled-on tariffs could put new vehicles out of reach for many would-be buyers, especially given rising indications of potentiallybroader inflation ahead throughout the economy.  “Starting almost immediately, consumers will see their already expensive new vehicles cost hundreds to thousands more and those prices will escalate even more when the supplies of many key vehicles dwindle,” Fiorani said. “Imagine the price rises during the semiconductor shortage and stretch it out across every brand and manufacturer. The trickle-down effect will put smaller suppliers out of business and send many workers onto unemployment.”        By raising new vehicle prices, tariffs will likely send buyers to the used market. But with limited used inventory, an influx of buyers could rock used car prices, too. And they already average $25,000.  Lease penetration, or the number of vehicle transactions that are leases, has averaged around 30% or so over the past 10 years, according to Edmunds data. New automobiles are loaded at the Port Newark Container Terminal in Newark, N.J., on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)   But the industry saw low rates of leasing — nearly half the norm — particularly between May 2022 and January 2023. Fewer leased vehicles typically means fewer two- or three-year-old vehicles being put on the used-car market.  So there is likely to be a shortage of used cars just as more buyers start shopping for them.    Governor Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents U.S. automakers, said that manufacturers supported Trump’s efforts to boost domestic auto manufacturing. But he cautioned that “it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector.  The United Auto Workers labor union applauded the tariffs. “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S.”  But Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, which represents international auto manufacturers, denounced the tariffs: “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S.”   Wiseman reported from Washington.

(AP) — Lawyers forMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student facing deportation for his role in pro-Palestinian campus protests, urged a federal judge on Friday to free their client from an immigration detention center in Louisiana, describing his imprisonment there as a “Kafkaesque” ploy to chill free speech. “The longer we wait, the more chill there is,” defense attorney Baher Azmy said. “Everyone knows about this case and is wondering if they’re going to get picked off the street for opposing U.S. foreign policy.” The parties appeared Friday morning before a judge in Newark, New Jersey, to debate where Khalil’s legal fight to be released from federal custody should play out. An attorney for the Department of Justice, August Flentje, wants the dispute litigated in Louisiana, where Khalil was taken after his arrest, “for jurisdictional certainty.” U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said he would consider the “tricky” venue issues at play and issue a written decision soon. He declined to hear an argument for bail from Khalil’s attorneys, pointing to the need to settle the jurisdictional issue first. Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdallah, an American citizen who is due to give birth next month, sat in the front row of the courtroom, surrounded by supporters. Scores of demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse on Friday morning, chanting, “Free Mahmoud,” and hoisting signs featuring his face.  “No matter what happens in court, what’s most important is for all of us to keep up the pressure,” said Ramzi Kassem, one of Khalil’s lawyers, after the hearing. “To let this government know that it cannot suppress speech.” President Donald Trump’s administration has, in recent weeks,ramped up efforts to arrest and deport student activistswho participated in protests against Israel. Khalil served as anegotiator for pro-Palestinian Columbia studentsas they bargained with university officials over an end to their campus tent encampment last spring. The university ultimately called in the police to dismantle the encampment and a faction of protesters who seized an administration building. Khalil was not among the people arrested in the Columbia protests and he has not been accused of any crime. But the Trump administration has said it wants to deport Khalil because of his prominent role in the protests, which they say amounted to antisemitic support for Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. The government cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to deport noncitizens whose presence in the country threatens U.S. foreign-policy interests. Khalil was born in Syria but is a legal U.S. resident. People involved in the student-led protests deny that their criticism of Israel or support of Palestinian territorial claims is antisemitic. U.S. officials also have accused Khalil of failing to disclose some of his work history on his immigration paperwork, including work at a British embassy and an internship with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. He was arrested March 8 in New York, then transferred overnight to an immigration detention facility in New Jersey. Hours later, he was put on a plane and whisked toa different immigration facilityin Jena, Louisiana. Azmy, one of Kahlil’s lawyers, said the Trump administration’s refusal to move the case back to the metropolitan New York City area rested on a “radical reinterpretation” of Habeas corpus, a legal process that allows individuals to challenge their detention. “They keep passing around the body in an almost Kafkaesque way,” he added. He also invoked the federal government’s recent arrest ofRumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student who was detained by immigration agents in Massachusetts this week and then immediately sent to Louisiana before her attorneys could secure a judge’s order blocking the transfer. “If you dismiss and we file in Louisiana, before the papers hit, he could be in Texas,” said Azmy. An attorney for the government replied that there were no immediate plans to move Khalil out of Louisiana. Other university students and faculty across the country have been arrested by immigration officials, had their visas revoked or been prevented from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. Among them are aGambian studentat Cornell University in upstate New York, anIndian scholarat Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., aLebanese doctorat Brown University’s medical school in Rhode Island and aKorean studentat Columbia who has lived in the country since she was 7.

Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, was taken by masked immigration officialsas she walked along a streetin the Boston suburb of Somerville on Tuesday. Ozturk was quickly moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in remote Basile, Louisiana, before her attorneys could secure a judge’s order blocking the transfer. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper gave the government until Tuesday evening to respond to an updated complaint filed by Ozturk’s attorneys. “To allow the Court’s resolution of its jurisdiction to decide the petition, Ozturk shall not be removed from the United States until further order of this court,” the judge wrote. Ozturk is amongseveral people with ties to American universitieswhoattended demonstrationsorpublicly expressed support for Palestiniansduring the war in Gaza and who have recently had visas revoked or been stopped from entering the U.S. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson has confirmed Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa, saying investigations found Oztruk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. The department did not provide evidence of that support. Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in an attack that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and during which about 250 hostages were seized.Israel’s retaliatory offensivehas killed more than 50,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.  Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily last year that criticized the university’s response to student demands that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Friends have said Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel.

Giovanni Impellizzeri, 27, of Vineland, apologized for his actions before the sentence was handed down, saying he had no excuses for his behavior. Impellizzeri was working as a custodian for the Upper Deerfield Township School District in 2023 when authorities became aware of videos that he recorded himself contaminating the food and utensils, the Cumberland County Prosecutor’s Office said. He then shared the videos online, officials said. When county health officials first became aware of the allegations in 2023, they said the fluids were unlikely to cause health problems and have said no illnesses related to the incidents have been reported. Impellizzeri had pleaded guilty in January to an official misconduct charge and an unrelated count of possessing child sexual abuse material.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP File)     President Donald Trump’s FCC commissioner said Friday he’s opening an investigation into the Walt Disney Co. and its ABC television network to see whether they are “promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr announced the probe ina letterto Disney CEO Robert Iger on Friday. The company said it was reviewing the letter and looking forward to answering the commission’s questions. The new administration hastaken an aggressive posturetoward the media on several fronts. Just this week, there were court hearings on theshutdown of Voice of Americaand thepresident’s dispute with The Associated Pressover how the news agency refers to the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has ordered renamed the Gulf of America. Carr has pushed the Federal Communications Commission into an activist role since Trump appointed him as its leader. For example, the FCC currently has open investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. “For decades, Disney focused on churning out box office and programming successes,” Carr wrote to Iger. “But then something changed. Disney has now become embroiled in rounds of controversy surrounding its DEI policies.” He said that while he has seen reports that Disney has rolled back some of its practices, “significant concerns remain.” Last month, Axios reported that Disney had made some policy changes, including eliminating a website designed to highlight personalities and stories from underrepresented communities.  Disney also softened messages that appeared before showings of movies like “Dumbo” and “Peter Pan,” Axios said. Instead of warnings that the films include “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of peoples or culture,” the messages changed to “this program is presented as originally created and may contain stereotypes or negative depictions.” Carr’s letter linked to an article by conservative activist Christopher Rufo describing Disney as “the wokest place on Earth.” Some examples Carr cited go back several years, such as a one-time policy at Disney-owned ABC that at least 50 percent of characters in TV pilots be from underrepresented groups. The letter cites a statement by a Disney executive in 2021 that it rejected some TV pilots because they didn’t satisfy inclusion standards. Trump has targeted all manner of DEI — standing for diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts across both public and private organizations. “At my direction, the FCC has already taken action to end its own promotion of DEI,” Carr wrote. “I have been pleased to see that some regulated companies are already taking steps toward rooting out discriminatory DEI policies.” David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

The fate of addiction treatment hangs in the balance with Kennedy’s HHS overhaul,https://apnews.com/article/hhs-addiction-mental-health-rfk-samsha-e83db20b4ef801971cd25d07eb41bcf9,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A box containing free doses of naloxone, a nasal spray medication to reverse drug overdoses, is installed at Ontario Beach Park in Rochester, N.Y., on Monday, Sept. 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) A little-known federal agency that touches the lives of people across the United States by funding the 988 crisis line, naloxone distribution and addiction treatment may be weakened and possibly eliminated in theproposed overhaulof the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. InHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‘s plan, the $8 billion Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, would be absorbed into a new office, where its more than 700 staffers would co-exist with employees from other agencies responsible for chemical exposures and work-related injuries. In all, five agencies are to be swallowed up under what will be called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, echoing Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again slogan. Merging SAMHSA into a larger agency “will increase operational efficiency and assure programs are carried out because it will break down artificial divisions between similar programs,” according to an HHS news release. “Millions of Americans who get mental health and substance use services depend on SAMHSA even if they have never heard the name of the agency,” said Brendan Saloner, an addiction researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. During Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, he said he was addicted to heroin for 14 years and has been in recovery for 42 years. He called medication-assisted treatment such as Suboxone (buprenorphine) and methadone medically necessary — but also said he considers the gold standard to be 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. During his presidential campaign, Kennedy had proposed a network of “healing farms” where people could work while recovering from addiction.  SAMHSA was created by Congress in 1992, so closing it is illegal and raises questions about Kennedy’s commitment to treating addiction and mental health, said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University addiction researcher. “Burying the agency in an administrative blob with no clear purpose is not the way to highlight the problem or coordinate a response,” Humphreys said. Other experts said crippling SAMSHA could stallprogress on overdose deaths.The agency regulates methadone clinics and pays for addiction prevention efforts in all 50 states. “There’s a reason why we have reduced overdose in this country, it’s because SAMHSA has been doing its job so well,” said Dr. Ruth Potee, medical director for seven methadone clinics in Massachusetts. “My jaw drops at this news.” Noting the24% decline in drug overdose deathsover a recent 12-month period, former White House drug czar Dr. Rahul Gupta said he’s concerned the bureaucratic overhaul will slow momentum. “A worsening overdose crisis is the last thing our nation needs,” said Gupta, who served under President Joe Biden. The announcement followsweeks of dismissals and grant terminationsthat have created an atmosphere of shock and fear among government-funded researchers and federal health employees. Saloner said overhauling a large organization could be done in a way that leads to better services for people, “but I am troubled by the lack of a deliberative process that seems to be creating chaos and driving really talented people out of the federal workforce.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, March 16, 2023. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via AP, File)     After Chief Justice John Robertsrebuked callsthis week by the Trump administration to impeach judges, social media users falsely claimed that he and other high-level legal professionals are part of a “secretive, invite only club.” Many questioned the motives of members, hinting at coordinated efforts to oppose President Donald Trump. Among those named was U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who Trump had demanded be removed from the bench for his order blocking deportation flights that the president was carrying out by invokingwartime authoritiesfrom 18th century law. But the group in question — the American Inns of Court — is hardly secretive given its large public presence, and there is no evidence that members are involved in nefarious activities targeting Trump. Roberts is no longer an active member and Boasberg is the president of a chapter that is no longer affiliated with the parent association. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Roberts, Boasberg and other powerful legal professionals are part of a secret, invite-only club that is working against Trump. THE FACTS: This is false. Roberts was a member of the Edward Coke Appellate Inn of Court chapter of the organization prior to his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005, but he is not currently an active member of the organization, according to Executive Director Malinda Dunn. Boasbergis the presidentof the Edward Bennett Williams Inn of Court, but the chapter disaffiliated from the parent association about 10 years ago when it decided it no longer wanted to pay dues to the national group, Dunn said. He was an active member prior to the chapter’s decision to operate independently.  Information on the American Inns of Court isreadily availableonline. Chapters also have their own websites, which often include details about programs they host for members, typically focused on networking, education and mentorship. Dunn said that members have a wide range of political opinions, but that the organization itself is “assiduously apolitical.” Some on social media, however, baselessly claimed that there is more to the group than meets the eye. “It has been revealed that Chief Justice John Roberts is part of an elite, invite-only group called the American Inns of Court, alongside some of the most openly anti-Trump judges in D.C.,” reads one X post. And yet a check of other members reveals a diverse group. Many current and former Supreme Court justices have been members of the American Inns of Court, according to Dunn, including Sandra Day O’Connor, Neil Gorsuch, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Clarence Thomas. Inns of Court have existed in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years. The American system, founded in 1980 out of discussions among legal professionals, including Chief Justice Warren Burger, is loosely based on this concept from across the pond. The American Inns of Court stateson its websitethat it is “dedicated to professionalism, ethics, civility, and excellence” and that its mission is to “inspire the legal community to advance the rule of law by achieving the highest level of professionalism through example, education, and mentoring.” O’Connor said in a2015 videothat “maintaining and improving an ethics of professionalism is what the American Inns of Court are all about.” There are more than 300 active chapters across the U.S. Each one manages its own membership and some are limited to practitioners in a certain legal field. Roberts’ former chapter, for example,states that“members are elected to the Inn after being nominated by a current member” and that they must be “actively engaged in appellate practice.” Dunn said chapters are advised to ensure that their members include legal professionals with different levels of experience. Some may hold membership drives to recruit new faces. Roberts is currently anhonorary bencherin The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, an inn of court in the U.K. This is a purely ceremonial role that, according to Dunn. British inns of court will always offer such a position to Supreme Court justices when they are confirmed, she said. Representatives for Roberts and Boasberg did not respond to a request for comment.

(AP Photo/Ken Ritter, File) LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nevada gaming regulators have issued a $10.5 million fine against the Resorts World casino on the Las Vegas Strip over allegations of illegal gambling, many of which centered on a bookmaker with ties to the interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani. The fine settles a complaint that the state Gaming Control Boardfiled last yearaccusing one of the largest casinos on the Strip of welcoming people with ties to illegal bookmaking and people with a history of gambling-related felony convictions, the Las Vegas Review-Journalreported. The fine, issued on Thursday, is the second-largest handed down by the Nevada Gaming Commission, which has authority over disciplinary action. As part of the settlement agreement, Resorts World and its parent company neither admit to nor deny the allegations. But the casino agreed to make changes to its leadership and implement stricter protocols for preventing money laundering, the newspaper reported. Resorts World did not immediately respond Friday to requests for comment from The Associated Press. Many of the allegations centered on Mathew Bowyer, a Southern California bookmaker who took thousands of sports bets from the formerinterpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani. Bowyer haspleaded guiltyin federal court in Santa Ana, California, to running an illegal gambling business and is awaiting sentencing. The Nevada Gaming Control Board alleged that Resorts World allowed Bowyer to play 80 separate days over about 15 months, while repeatedly failing to verify his source of funding. Bowyer lost over $6.6 million during that time, while the casino extended gifts, discounts and flights on its private jet, according to the complaint.  The complaint originally listed 12 counts against Resorts World — six related to Bowyer — including failing to distance from suspected illegal bookmakers, failure of casino hosts to report suspected illegal bookings and hosts referring prospective customers to suspected illegal bookmakers. Other counts were related to hundreds of thousands of dollars in credit to others with histories of illegal gambling convictions or organized crime — one of whom was convicted of conducting an illegal gambling business and another who was convicted in a large-scale internet gambling operation.

(AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)                      DENVER (AP) — As Americansstruggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp — yes, the marijuana cousin — to make building blocks for walls.  It’s a response tothe country’s shortfall of millions of homesthat has led to skyrocketing prices,plunging millions into poverty.  “There’s not enough homes to purchase and there’s not enough places to rent. Period,” said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden. A worker inspects the framing of a modular home at the Fading West factory in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)   One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. “I can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing” decades ago.  So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?       In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.  At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.  The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said. A worker constructs part of a modular home at the Fading West factory in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)   Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.  The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who’ve been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.  That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.  “You can build faster. The faster you build — even at a high quality — means the lower the price,” Schaefer said. “We see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.”  There’s a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.  Manufactured housingis similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis — like a trailer — and they aren’t subject to the same local building codes. That’s part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.  Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.   Modular homes built by Fading West are seen in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)       Yes, there’s technology to 3D print homes.  A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.  Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.  It’s “a long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,” Hamel said.  The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It’s also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.  The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said  It’s “a technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,” Memari said. “The challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.” Workers construct modular homes at the Fading West factory in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025. ( AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)         Hemp — the plant related to marijuana — is being used more and more in the construction of walls.  The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming “hempcrete,” a natural insulation that’s mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.  Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn’t need the wood studs.  As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.  The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congresslegalized the productionof certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.  Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.  Still, he said, “hempcrete has a bright future.” Modular homes wrapped in plastic await shipping outside of the Fading West factory in Buena Vista, Colo., on Feb. 19, 2025.

(Tracie Hunter via AP)         Sgt. Joe Harris, believed to be the oldest surviving World War II paratrooper and a member of the U.S. Army’s firstall-Black parachute infantry battalion, has died. He was 108. Harris died March 15 in a hospital in Los Angeles surrounded by family, grandson Ashton Pittman told The Associated Press. He will be honored with a full military funeral on April 5. “He was a very loving, loving, loving man,” said Pittman. “That was one of the things that he was very strict upon was loving one another.” Harris was among thelast surviving membersof the historic 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, nicknamed the Triple Nickles. The battalion helped protect the U.S. from deadly Japanese balloon bombs, according to Robert L. Bartlett, a retired Eastern Washington University professor who specializes in the 555th. In 1944 and 1945, the Japanese launched thousands of the balloons to be carried by the Pacific jet stream to the U.S. mainland to explode and start fires. During World War II,Black Americanswere often relegated to more support-level jobs in theracially segregated militaryand President Franklin Roosevelt faced pressure to put them in combat units. As a result, the military recruited Harris and hundreds of other Black men, trained them and sent them into blazes on the West Coast, where they fought fires, Bartlett said. Throughout their time in the military, they faced overt racism, including being barred from going to the base commissary and officer’s clubs unless they were specifically for Black people.  “This unit had to fight to be recognized as human beings while training to fight an enemy overseas, fight in their own country for respect even within the military,” Bartlett said. That was not lost on Pittman, who said his grandfather was brave enough to serve the U.S. “during a time when the country didn’t love him, honestly, didn’t care about him.” Harris was born on June 19, 1916, in West Dale, Louisiana, according to Tracie Hunter, spokesperson for WWII Beyond The Call, a nonprofit organization that works to document veterans’ accounts. After filling out his draft registration card, he began his military service in 1941 when he was 24. By the time he was honorably discharged in November 1945, he had completed 72 parachute jumps, according to Hunter. After the war, he worked for the U.S. Border Patrol. He also spent more than 60 years in Compton, California, where Pittman said he was the neighborhood patriarch, a man everyone on the block knew and gravitated to. “His life is to be celebrated,” Pittman said. “Obviously people are going to morn because he’s not here anymore. But ultimately what I know from conversations that I’ve had with my grandfather is that he wants to be celebrated. He deserves to be celebrated.” He is survived by his son, Pirate Joe Harris Sr., and two daughters, Michaun Harris and Latanya Pittman, along with five grandchildren, according to Hunter. His wife, Louise Harris, died in 1981, and a sixth grandchild has also died. Pittman said that his grandfather would sometimes ask him if he would ever jump out of a plane. In October, Pittman had the opportunity to follow in his grandfather’s airborne footsteps. For a week, he did paratrooper jump training in Corsicana, Texas, through the Liberty Jump Team, an organization that works to preserve the memory of veterans. “When I got my wings, I actually broke down and started crying because everything in that moment just resonated with me,” he said. “It was like, dang I’m literally doing what my grandfather did.” Shortly before Harris’ death, he got a landing zone, in Tuskegee, Alabama, dedicated in his name. Pittman said he plans to be the very first person to jump in the Sgt. Joe Harris Dropzone.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

President Trump announced plans to issue an executive order aimed at the Smithsonian Institution, targeting funding for programs promoting what he calls “divisive narratives” and “improper ideology,” as part of his broader push against liberal culture.

Travers, Feb. 10, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)      NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”targets the Smithsonian Institution— which has, he contends, “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” Critics have pushed back, saying the order is an attempt to whitewash American history. His order is part of a wave of actions against cultural organizations that he alleges have been overtaken by “woke” ideology,from the Kennedy Centerto theInstitute of Museum and Library Services. The Voice of America and PBS are also in his sights. Trump has tasked Vice President JD Vance to lead the effort to “effectuate the policies” of the executive order, including to ensure no funding goes to “exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.” Here’s a look at the Smithsonian Institution and what’s going on with it. With an annual budget exceeding $1 billion, the Smithsonian is the “world’s largest museum, education, and research complex,” according to its website. It was conceived in the 19th century by the British scientist James Smithson, who bequeathed his estate for the purpose of a Washington-based establishment that helps with “the increase and diffusion of knowledge.” In 1846, 17 years after Smithson’s death, President James K. Polk signed legislation calling for the Institution’s formation.  The Smithsonian now operates a broad range of cultural centers in Washington and beyond, including the Air and Space Museum, the Portrait Gallery, the National Zoo and the Smithsonian Gardens. Around 60% of its funding is from the federal government, but the Institution also receives money from “trust funds or non-federal funds, which include contributions from private sources,” according to its website. In his executive order, he made the claim that “the National Museum of African American History and Culture has proclaimed that ‘hard work,’ ‘individualism,’ and ‘the nuclear family’ are aspects of ‘White culture’” and criticized an upcoming exhibit at the American Women’s History Museum that highlights the achievements of trans athletes. He also singled out an exhibit at the American Art Museum that “promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct.” In 2017, Trump visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture with then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Alveda King, a niece of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The president’s tour was guided by Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian Institution’s current secretary and founding director of NMAAHC. The museum includes an exhibit highlighting the career achievements of Carson, a successful pediatric neurosurgeon who has long been celebrated as a role model to aspiring Black medical doctors. “I’m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,” Trump said following the 2017 tour. “I know President (Barack) Obama was here for the museum’s opening last fall. And I’m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.” Trump’s executive order and its potential impact were met with dismay. Dorothy Wilson, visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture for the first time with her two grandchildren on Friday, said she was very concerned about what it would mean for them and others if they weren’t able to learn the truth about the past. “It really hurts generations because your history is who you are,” she said. Elizabeth Pagano, coming from New York state’s Hudson Valley, said: “The history of the United States, and the history of everybody that came through, is everybody’s history. You can’t pick and choose your history.” Holly Brewer, the Burke Professor of American History at the University of Maryland, identified what she called a troubling aspect of the order: It prohibits certain questions from being asked. “You’re not allowed to ask about how societies have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege and disenfranchisement when, of course, race was explicit in so many laws,” she said. “I don’t know how you can actually study history and be barred from asking questions like that. And I don’t know how you can show American history without acknowledging some of that.” It’s a troubling fiction to insist “that the greatness of America can only exist if we deny ever making mistakes, if we deny ever doing things bad, if we deny that there were times in our history when when terrible things happened,” said Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Ala., which has created sites including a memorial to lynching victims to wrestle with the country’s racial history. “That’s not how you become great,” he said. “That’s not how you become strong.” In a statement, Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said, “Black history is U.S. history. Women’s history is U.S. history. This country’s history is ugly and beautiful. And each historic struggle for civil rights has advanced our movement toward a truly inclusive, multiracial democracy.” Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela in New York and writer Gary Fields and videojournalist Mike Pesoli in Washington contributed.

Charles canceled planned engagements on Thursday afternoon and Friday on the advice of his doctors, Buckingham Palace said, without providing details about the “temporary side effects” that he experienced. But the episode was a reminder that the king is 76 and continues to undergo treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer diagnosed more than a year ago. That reality has slipped away from the collective consciousness since last spring, when Charles returned to public duties after stepping away for almost three months to focus on his initial treatment and recovery. In the intervening months, he has attended D-Day commemoration events in France, presided over the State Opening of Parliament and even embarked on a nine-day visit to Australia and Samoa. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports King Charles III has been seen in public for first time since his brief hospitalization for the side effects from his cancer treatment. But during the early stages of his treatment, Charlescontinued fulfilling his constitutional dutiesas head of state, including reviewing government papers and meeting with the prime minister. Here’s a brief rundown of what we know about the king’s health.  The king went to the London Clinic on Thursday morning for a scheduled cancer treatment. The clinic is a private hospital in central London, where Charles has been receiving treatment since his diagnosis in February 2024. “Following scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer this morning, the king experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement. “His majesty’s afternoon engagements were therefore postponed.” The king then returned to his home at Clarence House, where he reviewed papers and made calls, the palace said. Queen Camilla didn’t join him at the hospital. “His majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result,” the palace said in a statement. The king is expected to press ahead with his work in the coming days, including a state visit to Italy scheduled for early April. Palace officials have recognized that it’s better to release some information about the king’s health, rather than allow media speculation to fill the void when he’s forced to cancel scheduled events. But they have tried to walk a fine line, seeking to balance the public’s legitimate interest in the health of the head of state with Charles’ right to privacy. This was seen first in January 2024, when the palace announced Charles was being treated for an enlarged prostate, followed by the cancer diagnosis a few weeks later. The decision to talk about the king’s health issues marked a departure from past palace protocols. For example, when Queen Elizabeth II began missing events toward the end of her life, royal officials repeatedly said that she was suffering from “mobility issues,” without providing further details. Her death certificate listed the cause as “old age.” The public was unaware that Charles’ grandfather, King George VI, had lung cancer before his death in February 1952 at the age of 56. Some historians suggest that even the king wasn’t told about the gravity of his condition. Health authorities have applauded the king’s openness, saying his disclosures saved lives by encouraging thousands of men to have prostate exams. Royal experts say Charles’ candor has also brought him closer to the public by demonstrating that he faces the same kinds of challenges that they do. Health is, after all, the great leveler. Charles’ busy schedule is a reminder that this is a man who waited around seven decades to become monarch and he wants to make the most of it. The king has been open about his desire to demonstrate that the monarchy still has a role to play as a symbol of unity and tradition in the sometimes fractious, multicultural nation that is 21st-century Britain. And the job of a modern king is to take part in a whirl of public events, from the pageantry of state occasions when he wears the crown and rides through the streets of London in a horse-drawn carriage to more mundane appearances such as opening public buildings or handing out awards for public service. Charles took part in 372 public engagements last year, even after stepping aside for almost three months because of cancer treatment, according to data compiled by The Times of London newspaper. That made him the second-busiest royal behind his sister, Princes Anne, who had 474 engagements. Charles has long been known as a workaholic, and Queen Camilla said last year that he “won’t slow down and won’t do what he’s told.” During her Reading Room literary festival in July, the queen told author Lee Child that her husband was “doing fine,” but hadn’t heeded her advice to curtail his schedule. Prince Harry once said that his father worked so hard that he would fall asleep at his desk and wake up with bits of paper stuck to his face. The king’s busy schedule has obscured the fact that he is an older man with cancer, said Robert Hardman, author of “Charles III: New King, New Court, the Inside Story.” “We’ve seen him go back to normal,” Hardman told the BBC on Friday. “I think this is sort of a reminder that this is a head of state undergoing treatment for cancer, because I think a lot of us tended to forget it.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)                    TORONTO (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that his first call with newCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carneywas “extremely productive” and Carney said Trump respected Canada’s sovereignty both in private and public but added that the relationship has changed. The call came asTrump has declared a trade war on Canadaand has threatened to use economic coercion to make Canada the 51st U.S. state,a position that has infuriated Canadians. Trump avoided any mention of that in his social media post and in public remarks later. “We had a very good conversation. Mark called me,” Trump said. “We had a very very good talk. He’s going through an election. We’ll see what happens.” Trump didn’t refer to the prime minister as governor as he did with Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau. The U.S. president, in his social media post, said the two sides “agree on many things and will be meeting immediately after Canada’s upcoming Election to work on elements of Politics, Business, and all other factors, that will end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada.” But Trump said more tariffs are coming. And Carney said Trump didn’t say he would pull back on tariffs on steel and aluminum, autos and other products. “It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner. It is probable now that by negotiating we will able to restore an element of trust but we cannot go back,” Carney said.  Carney previously said he would talk to Trump if he respected Canada’s sovereignty. “The president respected Canada’s sovereignty today both in his private and public comments,” Carney said. He described the call as positive, cordial and constructive. “Exactly what we want,” Carney said. Carney said he will begin comprehensive negotiations for a “new economic and security relationship” immediately after the Canadian election on April 28. Carney, who replacedTrudeauas Canada’s leader and the head of the Liberal Party, is at the start of a five-week campaign. “What we need is a new agreement and a new partnership with the United States because there are too many changes, to many tariffs and too many threats coming at us,” Carney said. “There is too much uncertainty in that relationship. We made progress but we will see.” The former central banker was sworn in as Canada’s new prime minister on March 14. It’s unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office. Trump ramped up his trade war this week by announcing a 25% tariff on automobile imports. Autos are Canada’s second largest export. Trump previously placed 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as on all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. Carney said the significant transformation that Trump is seeking in repatriating manufacturing in the U.S. could lead to inflation and slowing growth. But he said reaching a deal with America’s most important trading partner will help Americans and Canadians. “We are going to end up with a very good relationship with Canada,” Trump said. Canada has previously said it would retaliate with counter tariffs, and Carney reiterated that in his call with Trump. U.S. Vice President JD Vance took a harder line with Canada on Friday, noting the country is threatening retaliatory tariffs. “As President Trump always says they just don’t have the cards,” Vance said in Greenland. “There is no way that Canada can win a trade war with the United States.” Vance claimed that for decades Canada has forced American farmers and manufacturers to play by an unfair set of rules. Trump renegotiated the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico in his first term. At the time Trump called it the “most modern, up-to-date, and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country, with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed.” Trump and Carney agreed that Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s minister of international trade, and United States Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, will intensify talks to address the coming tariffs in the interim. The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war and challenged Canada’s sovereignty. The crisis has created a surge in patriotism among Canadians, with many in the country feeling that Carney is the best person to lead the country at the moment. Trump previously acknowledged that he has upended Canadian politics. Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) A Sundance festivalgoer walks past the Egyptian Theatre during the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 25, 2025, in Park City, Utah. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File)          TheSundance Film Festivalis Boulder bound, leaving its home of four decades in Park City, Utah, for a new chapter in neighboring Colorado. Organizersannounced their decisionThursday after a yearlong search in which numerous U.S. cities vied to host the nation’s premier independent film festival. The other finalists were Cincinnati, Ohio, and a combinedSalt Lake City and Park City bid. Festival leaders said politics did not influence their move from conservative Utah to liberal Colorado. They did however make “ethos and equity values” one of their criteria and referred to Boulder in their announcement as a “welcoming environment.” Boulder stood out to organizers as an artsy, walkable and medium-sized city close to nature. It has one of the highest concentrations of professional artists in the U.S. and is home to the University of Colorado, where the film program contributes to a vibrant art scene, Sundance leaders said. They noted the large student population and campus venues will create new opportunities to engage young people in the event. Nearby nature in the Rocky Mountain foothills offers room for visitors and artists to stretch their legs and draw inspiration from high country scenery. It’s also just over half an hour from downtown Denver and not much farther to the city’s international airport. There is not currently a light rail system connecting Denver to Boulder, but a bus runs between the two cities. When Sundance leaders began their search for a new home, they said the festival had outgrown the charming ski town of Park City and developed an air of exclusivity that took focus away from the films. Boulder, a city of 100,000 people, has space for a more centralized festival. But it’s not all that more affordable for attendees. The cost of living is estimated to be 31% higher than the national average, versus Park City’s 33%, according to the Economic Research Institute. Visitors also say it can be difficult to find available hotel rooms and short term rentals when the university hosts large events or home football games. Actor Jonah Hill, “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and — perhaps most significantly — Sundance founder Robert Redford all attended the University of Colorado in Boulder. The school has aheady party culturethat sometimes spills into the surrounding streets. The city is also home to a private Buddhist college. Redford, 88,gave the festival’s relocation his blessing. Redford is remembered in Boulder with a mural inside The Sink, a restaurant and bar where he worked as a janitor back in his college days. “It’s gonna be really fun to see what happens and when people are introduced to the beauty of Boulder and how amazing this place is. It’s just gonna elevate Boulder’s presence on the world stage, I think,” said Chris Heinritz, a co-owner of The Sink. Just outside Denver’s suburbs, Boulder has its own identity — and decades ago a very unique, hippie vibe. Well before Colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, thousands of University of Colorado students and others would gather on campus to smoke pot every April 20. Today, Boulder retains its charm at the foot of the sandstone Flatirons, a foothill range crisscrossed by hiking trails that begin at the Colorado Chautauqua, a cultural and performing arts hub dating to the 1800s. The pedestrian-only Pearl Street Mall with its nearby theaters could provide a similar central hub to Park City’s Main Street. It’s no longer ideal for hippies, however. The university kicked the 4/20 weed fest off campus and soaring housing costs — the median home price is now $1.1 million — make living there unattainable for most. Films have been shown in Boulder since 1898, when the first kinetoscope, a device co-invented by Thomas Edison, showed moving pictures to one person at a time at the Chautauqua Auditorium. Besides Redford, Hollywood names who attended the University of Colorado include Dalton Trumbo, a screenwriter for “Spartacus” and “Roman Holiday” who was among the Hollywood Ten blacklisted for suspected communist sympathies in the late 1940s and 1950s. In the 1970s and 1980s, Boulder locations featured as backdrops in the Woody Allen film “Sleeper” and Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining.” And Boulder was the fictional setting of the TV show “Mork & Mindy.” Today, it’s home to more than a dozen smaller film festivals, including the Boulder International Film Festival and Chautauqua Silent Film Series. “It just makes perfect sense. We’re a small teeny tiny town but we’re filled with so much. We have so much art so much history, so much vibrancy,” said Hannah Givens, a University of Colorado graduate who lives in the Boulder area. Sundance has called Park City home for 41 years. Past leaders of the festival said Redford chose the mountains of Utah as a space to foster independent filmmaking away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. Utah’s iconic red rock landscapes have served as a backdrop to many films, including “Thelma and Louise,” “Forrest Gump” and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” for which the festival is named. This year, thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read “Keep Sundance in Utah” in a last-ditch effort to convince its leaders to keep it local. Sundance will have one more festival in Park City in January 2026 before moving to Boulder in 2027. Over four decades, Sundance helped transform its quaint mountain hometown into a renowned winter destination. Home prices skyrocketed, luxury hotels emerged and some local businesses shuttered while others thrived. Out-of-state visitors spent an estimated $106.4 million in Utah during the 2024 festival. Its total economic impact that year was estimated at $132 million, with 1,730 jobs for Utah residents and $70 million in wages for local workers. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he was sad to see Sundance go, but the state’s economy could sustain the loss. Utah offered Sundance $3.5 million to stay. Colorado lawmakers proposed $34 million in tax credits over 10 years to lure it away. Associated Press journalist Thomas Peipert contributed to this report from Boulder, Colorado.

But that’s not so easy when your movie is about a handful of people off the coast of Wales brought together by old songs. Yet one of many charms of“The Ballad of Wallis Island”is that it has no intentions of timeliness. It has nothing to do with “now,” which, in a way, might make it all the better suited to today. “Weirdly, it’s not a right-now movie, but that’s what makes it a right-now movie. Hopefully it’s heartwarming, and everything’s falling apart at the moment,” says Tim Key, who co-stars in and co-wrote the film with Tom Basden. “So I guess that’s a good thing.” “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” which Focus Features released Friday in theaters, stars Basden as Herb McGwyer, a famous folk musician turned pop star who, in the opening scenes, arrives at the rural seaside home of Charles (Key) for a private £500,000 ($647, 408) gig. After his chipper host helps him off the skiff and into the water (“Dame Judi Drenched,” Charles pronounces), Herb learns he’ll be performing for “less than 100” people. Just how significantly less unspools over the gentle, funny and sweetly poignant “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” the springtime movie release that may be most likely to leave audiences saying: “I needed that.” “Both of us have felt there’s a case to be made for stuff that isn’t relevant, that isn’t satirical, that isn’t a comment on the story of the day,” says Basden. “Those are the films that have meant the most to me over the years. They’re the ones that let me escape from the here and now. But it’s not always easy to get people to see it that way when you’re getting things made.”  “The Ballad of Wallis Island” is, itself, a product of time. It’s based on a 2007 short that Key and Basden made together when they, and director James Griffiths, were just starting out in show business. All three have since gone on to their respective, often overlapping careers. Key and Basden began in sketch comedy (their group was called the Cowards) and have been regular presences across offbeat British comedy. Key co-starred in Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge series and hosteda comic poetry hour radio showwith Basden providing musical accompaniment. Basden, who created the BBC sitcom “Here We Go,” has, among other things, written plays, including a riff on Franz Kafka’s “The Trial,” starring Key. When Basden and Key, now in their 40s, made 2007’s“The One and Only Herb McGwyer Plays Wallis Island,”they knew little of what lay ahead for them, let alone much about how to make a movie. “I don’t have any sort of discernable haircut,” says Key looking back. “I’m wearing my father’s cardigan.” But while the premise — the soggy collision between cynical star and lonely superfan — was thin, the concept of the BAFTA-nominated short stuck with Key, Basden and Griffiths. Griffiths, who moved on to directing series like “black-ish,” “Stumptown” and “Bad Sisters,” wanted to revisit the short during the pandemic. “Tim and Tom spent a lot of time in nature’s makeup chair. They’ve become the right age for the characters,” says Griffiths. “When we made the short, it was very much the idea of a sketch – an odd couple on an island. But over time, we’ve all grown up and as we’ve expanded on those characters, you start to see you’re commenting on your own lived experience.” In the script, Key and Basden decided to only slightly expand the cast, most notably creating the role of Nell Mortimer, the former folk singing partner of Herb’s. The arrival of Nell, played byCarey Mulligan,brings up much about Herb’s past as part of the duo known as McGwyer Mortimer, who represent an authenticity in music Herb lost long ago. For Charles, a genial pun-happy puppy dog of a man who says things like “Wowsers in your trousers,” McGwyer Mortimer’s music represents something nostalgic from an earlier relationship, too. “You can probably tell from our characters in the film that Tim has a much more positive energy than me, generally,” says Basden. “And I have absolutely leaned on his optimism over the years to counteract my natural pessimism. I count myself very lucky that I have Tim in my life for that reason alone. Mulligan, an executive producer on the film, didn’t hesitate to join despite, as Key says, “huge question marks over whether or not we could keep our composure with Carey Mulligan.” “I was a huge Tim Key fan and Tom (fan). We were obsessed with the late-night poetry hour,” says Mulligan, who’s married to folk star Marcus Mumford. “Before I even read it, my husband was like, ‘You’ve got to do it.’” Though Mulligan has starred in many films that speak more directly to their times (“She Said,” “Promising Young Woman,” “Suffragette”), she reveled in the the un-timeliness of “Wallis Island.” With it, Mulligan, a co-star in the Coen brothers’“Inside Llewyn Davis,”becomes the rare actor to appear in not one but two movies about dissolved folk duos. “It’s generous and it’s compassionate, and a reminder of what generosity can be and compassion can look like,” Mulligan says. “A big part of my attraction to it was its unseriousness and its lack of quote-unquote ‘importance.’ I was like, ‘I want to make something that’s just lovely.’” Griffiths, who grew up enamored of the films of Bill Forsyth, was inspired by the much-adored 1983“Local Hero,”which likewise centers around an outsider arriving on a far-away United Kingdom coastline. (In “Local Hero,” it’s Scotland.) Griffiths, who divorced in the intervening years, wanted to return to “Wallis Island” much as its characters are seeking to revive something from their past. “You look back and go: ‘Oh, I got here and I didn’t expect to be making this kind of work,’” says Griffiths. “I wanted to press the reset button a little bit and make something I really wanted to make.” How you make something sincerely heartwarming without tipping into over-sentimentality has bedeviled most Hollywood moviemakers for the better part of a century. In the case of “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” the key ingredient, perhaps, besides the abiding friendship of Key and Basden, was simply time. “There’s something about going back to a project you made 18 years earlier and then realizing you’re making a film about people who are obsessed with their life 15 years earlier,” says Basden. “You’re like: Hang on a minute. I haven’t used my imagination at all.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
Jury from outside of Memphis will hear the case of 3 former officers charged in Tyre Nichols’ death,https://apnews.com/article/tyre-nichols-beating-death-memphis-officers-trial-9fccebf026383125cacf03ea26b55d67,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(City of Memphis via AP, File) MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A jury from outside of Memphis will be seated in the state court trial of three former police officers charged with second-degree murder in the beating death ofTyre Nicholsafter a traffic stop in 2023, a judge ruled Friday. Shelby County Judge James Jones Jr. did not specify where the jury will come from to hear the case against former Memphis Police Department officers Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty in Nichols’ death. Two other officers, Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., also have been charged with second-degree murder but will not stand trial with their former colleagues. Martin and Mills are expected to change their not guilty pleas in state court, according to lawyers involved in the case. After Friday’s hearing, prosecutor Paul Hagerman said only that the jury will come from elsewhere in Tennessee. The trial is scheduled to begin April 28. Police videoshowed officers pepper spraying Nichols, 29, and hitting him with a Taser before he ran away from the traffic stop on Jan. 7, 2023. The five officers chased down Nichols and kicked, punched and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home as he called out for his mother. The video showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. Nichols died three days after the beating. The five officers were fired, charged in state court with murder, and indicted by a federal grand jury on civil rights and witness tampering charges.  Martin and Mills pleaded guilty to the federal charges under deals with prosecutors.The other three officers were convictedin October of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating. Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges of using excessive force and being indifferent to Nichols’ serious injuries. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols’ civil rights causing death, but he was convicted of two lesser charges of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. Sentencingsfor the five officers in the federal case are pending. Nichols’ death led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the U.S. and directed intense scrutiny toward the police force in Memphis, a majority-Black city. A 17-month U.S. Justice Department investigation that the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people. The department is more than 50% Black. Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis is also Black. The five officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that has since been disbanded. The team targeted drugs, illegal guns and violent offenders, with the goal of amassing arrests, while sometimes using force against unarmed people.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kenya Hunter)             WASHINGTON (AP) — In a major overhaul,the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serviceswill lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the country. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient “sprawling bureaucracy” in a video announcing the restructuring Thursday. He faulted the department’s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans’ health. “I want to promise you now that we’re going to do more with less,” Kennedy said in the video, posted to social media. The restructuring plan caps weeks of tumult at the nation’s top health department, which has been embroiled inrumors of mass firings, the revocation of$11 billion in public health fundingfor cities and counties,a tepid responseto a measles outbreak, and controversial remarks about vaccines from its new leader. Still, Kennedy said a “painful period” lies ahead for HHS, which is responsible for monitoring infectious diseases, inspecting foods and hospitals, and overseeing health insurance programs for nearly half the country. Overall, the department will downsize to 62,000 positions, losing nearly a quarter of its staff — 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers encouraged by President Donald Trump’s administration.  The staffing cuts were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Public health experts, doctors, current and former HHS workers and congressional Democrats quickly panned Kennedy’s plans, warning they could have untold consequences for millions of people. “These staff cuts endanger public health and food safety,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, in a statement. “They raise serious concerns that the administration’s pledge to make Americans healthy again could become nothing more than an empty promise.” But Kennedy, in announcing the restructuring, blasted HHS for failing to improve Americans’ lifespans and not doing enough to drive down chronic disease and cancer rates. “All of that money,” Kennedy said of the department’s $1.7 trillion yearly budget, “has failed to improve the health of Americans.” Cancer death rates have dropped 34% over the past two decades, translating to 4.5 million deaths avoided, according to the American Cancer Society. That’s largely due to smoking cessation, the development of better treatments — many funded by the National Institutes of Health, including groundbreaking immunotherapy — and earlier detection. The reorganization plan also underscores Kennedy’s push to take more control of the public health agencies — the NIH, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which have traditionally operated with a level of autonomy from the health secretary. Under the plan, external communications, procurement, information technology and human resources will be centralized under HHS. Federal health workers — stationed across the country at agencies including at the NIH and FDA, both in Maryland — described shock, fear and anxiety rippling through their offices Thursday. Workers were not given advance notice of the cuts, several told The Associated Press, and many remained uncertain about whether their jobs were on the chopping block. “It’s incredibly difficult and frustrating and upsetting to not really know where we stand while we’re trying to keep doing the work,” said an FDA staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “We’re being villainized and handicapped and have this guillotine just hanging over our necks.” HHS on Thursday provided a breakdown of some of the cuts. __ 3,500 jobs at the FDA, which inspects and sets safety standards for medications, medical devices and foods. __ 2,400 jobs at the CDC, which monitors for infectious disease outbreaks and works with public health agencies nationwide. __ 1,200 jobs at the NIH, the world’s leading public health research arm. __ 300 jobs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Affordable Care Act marketplace, Medicare and Medicaid. HHS said it anticipates the changes will save $1.8 billion per year but didn’t give a breakdown or other details. The cuts and consolidation go far deeper than anyone expected, an NIH employee said. “We’re all pretty devastated,” said the staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We don’t know what this means for public health.” Union leaders for CDC workers in Atlanta said they received notice from HHS on Thursday morning that reductions will focus on administrative positions including human resources, finance, procurement and information technology. At CMS, where cuts focus on workers who troubleshoot problems that arise for Medicare beneficiaries and Affordable Care Act enrollees, the result will be the “lowest customer service standards” for thousands of cases, said Jeffrey Grant, a former deputy director at the agency who resigned last month. Beyond losing workers, Kennedy said he will shut down entire agencies, some of which were established by Congress decades ago. Several will be folded into a new Administration for a Healthy America, he said. Those include the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees and provides funding for hundreds of community health centers around the country, as well as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which funds clinics and overseesthe national 988 hotline. Both agencies pump billions of dollars into on-the-ground work in local communities. SAMHSA was created by Congress in 1992, so closing it is illegal and raises questions about Kennedy’s commitment to treating addiction and mental health, said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University addiction researcher. “Burying the agency in an administrative blob with no clear purpose is not the way to highlight the problem or coordinate a response,” Humphreys said. The Administration for Healthy America will focus on maternal and child health, environmental health and HIV/AIDS work, HHS said. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, created by a law signed by then-Republican President George W. Bush and responsible for maintaining the national stockpile that was quickly drained during the COVID-19 pandemic, will also be eliminated and moved into the CDC. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said the ramifications of Kennedy’s plans for HHS are unclear. “We’ll just wait and see what it is, and then we’ll go back and try to fix if there is something broken,” Rounds said. “That’s the approach we’ve taken so far.” But Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington warned that the fallout is clear. “It does not take a genius to understand that pushing out 20,000 workers at our preeminent health agencies won’t make Americans healthier,” Murray said in a statement. “It’ll just mean fewer health services for our communities, more opportunities for disease to spread, and longer waits for lifesaving treatments and cures.” Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Lauran Neergaard and Kevin Freking in Washington; JoNel Aleccia in Temecula, Calif.; Carla K.

(AP Photo/Hassan Ammar)             BEIRUT (AP) — An alreadyfragile ceasefirebetween Israel and the Lebanesemilitant group Hezbollahappeared to be on shaky ground Friday after rockets fired from Lebanon into northern Israeltriggered Israeli airstrikesin the suburbs of Beirut. The rocket launch from Lebanon was the second in a week, after a lull since December. In both cases, Hezbollah denied being behind the attacks. The Israeli military has continued tostrike regularly in southern Lebanon, but Friday was the first time it hit the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire deal brokered by the U.S. and France brought an end to the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. The exchange highlighted the tenuous nature of the deal and worried residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs and border communities in Israel, many of whom only recently returned to their homes after being displaced during the war. Here are details of the ceasefire deal and a look at how Friday’s blowup might affect it.  Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day afterits ally Hamaslaunched adeadly attack into Israelthat ignitedthe war in Gaza. Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling, and the two sides were locked in a low-level conflict for nearly a year. In September 2024, the exchange of fire escalatedinto a full-scale war. Israel launched widespread aerial bombardment of the country and a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. More than 4,000 people were killed in Lebanon, including much of Hezbollah’s top leadership but also hundreds of civilians. The internationally brokered dealthat ended the war called forboth Hezbollah and Israeli forces to withdrawfrom the area south of the Litani River in Lebanon, which would be patrolled by a beefed-up Lebanese army, along with U.N. peacekeepers. The agreement called for Lebanese authorities to prevent Hezbollah and other armed groups from launching attacks on Israel and for Israel to halt “offensive military operations” in Lebanon. However, the deal allows both sides to act in “self defense” without defining what that means. It also left vague how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying that Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river. While the ceasefireended the all-out war, it did not end the conflict altogether. Israel has launched regular airstrikes in southern Lebanon since the agreement took effect, saying that it istargeting Hezbollah facilities and officialsto prevent the group from rearming. The initial deadline for Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon was in late January, but it was later extended to Feb. 18. When Israel did not withdraw from border villages by the original deadline, hundreds of demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter the villages, and Israeli troops opened fire, killing more than 20 people. After Feb. 18, Israeli forces withdrew from most of the border area but continued to occupy five strategic overlook points in southern Lebanon, saying that the military needed to maintain a presence there to protect border villages in northern Israel. Lebanese officials have called for a full withdrawal. The U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL said in a statement Friday that it has tracked more than 650 “trajectories” fired across the border since the ceasefire agreement took hold, with “the vast majority” of them traveling from Israel to Lebanon. It also reported more than 30 airstrikes in southern Lebanon and nearly 1,200 “activities” by Israeli ground troops. Hezbollah has announced only one strike on Israel since the ceasefire took effect, when it fired rockets into the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights in December. Hezbollah denied responsibility for this week’s launches into Israel — both of which were shot down — and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon. Some in Lebanon theorized that the launches were carried out by armed Palestinian factions, particularly since the launch pads discovered by the Lebanese army appeared to be primitive. But some analysts took the militant group’s denial with a grain of salt. Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank, said it is unlikely that the launches could have taken place without Hezbollah’s blessing. “At the end of the day, who’s active in southern Lebanon?” he said. Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Middle East programs, said the missiles could have been an authorized action by Hezbollah or the result of “an external actor who decided to make a point.” They could also have been an unauthorized action by “local Hezbollah guys who were upset at the fact that the leadership has been very passive” in the face of the Israeli attacks in Lebanon since the ceasefire, he said. Before and after the rare strike in Beirut, Israel hammered southern Lebanon with airstrikes, and officials said it would continue to do so. “We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a trickle,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “We will attack everywhere in Lebanon, against any threat to the state of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely.” Without peace in the northern Israel area of the Galilee, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, “there will be no peace in Beirut.” Hage Ali said Israel has been emboldened by the “carte blanche” it has received from the Trump administration to strike when and where it pleases in Lebanon despite the ceasefire. Hezbollah, meanwhile, does not appear to be in a position to return to sustained fighting. “Its deterrence is gone. The Israelis are not scared of Hezbollah anymore,” Blanford said. “This is the big change between before October 2023 and now.” But Hage Ali said that if Israel continues to take an aggressive stance in Lebanon, it could eventually backfire and “at some point, we’re going to see an implosion of the ceasefire.” Associated Press Writer Julia Frankel in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

Chinese researchers report a pig kidney transplant and a first-step liver experiment,https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-liver-organ-xenotransplant-china-b0bbc05b80bc7abed7dc7c0cdcf3a0e5,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A miniature pig waits for visitors to feed it at a zoo in Shanghai, China, on Thursday Feb. 15, 2007. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the questfor animal-to-human organ transplants– with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too. A Chinese patient is thethirdperson in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person. Scientists aregenetically altering pigsso their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. —two pig heartsandtwo pig kidneys– were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving – anAlabama womantransplanted in November and aNew Hampshire mantransplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin. Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient “is very well” and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi’an told reporters in a briefing this week. Wang, part of the hospital’s xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago. But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation — learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin — important for basic organ function — although not as much as human livers do.  The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting. “We do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,” Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver. In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of “bridge” supportby externally attaching a pig liverto a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach. In China, Wang’s team didn’t remove the deceased person’s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it. That “clouds the picture,” said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn’t involved with the work. “It’s hopefully a first step but it’s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.” Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome. According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it’s unclear how that experiment turned out.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart)       NEW YORK (AP) — The co-founders of a company that makes lip products for darker skin tones no longer hope to get their lineinto Target. A brother and sister who make jigsaw puzzles celebrating Black subjects wonder if they need to offer “neutral” images like landscapes to keep growing. Pound Cake and Puzzles of Color are among the small businesses whose owners are rethinking their plans as major U.S. companies weaken their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The initiatives mostly date from the endPresident Donald Trump’s first termand entered a new era with the dawn of his second one. Some Black-owned brands suspect big retail chains will droppartnerships they pursuedafter the police killing of a Black man in 2020 reignited mass protests against racial injustice. In today’s anti-DEI climate, other entrepreneurs worry about personal repercussions or feel pressure to cancel contracts withretreating retailers. “It becomes a question of, are the big box stores going to be there? Do we even make any attempt to talk to these people?” Ericka Chambers, one of the siblings behind Puzzles of Color, said. “We are really having to evaluate our strategy in how we expand and how we want to get in front of new customers.”  Chambers and her brother, William Jones, started turning the work of artists of color into frameable puzzles the same year a video captured a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling onGeorge Floyd’sneck. Amidthe Black Lives Matter protestsover Floyd’s death, a fashion designer challenged large retailers to devote 15% of their shelf space and purchasing power to Black businesses. The Fifteen Percent Pledge helped bring Puzzles of Color’s creations to Macy’s and Nordstrom’s websites in 2022. Last year, they made it into select Barnes & Noble stores. Chambers said she’s confident in the companies’ commitments but recalled a backlash after news outlets covered the brand, which is based in Texas. “It does make us think about how we envision ourselves as far as the safety of not wanting to be attacked, because some people are very vocal about being anti-DEI,” Chambers said. Vibrant depictions of Black women account for many of her and Jones’ puzzles. The pair figured they needed to provide more abstract designs for certain Barnes & Noble locations to give Puzzles of Color “a little bit of a fighting chance.” The first prominent names in U.S. retail to end or retooltheir diversity programssurfaced last summer amid threats of legal challenges and negative publicity from DEI critics, who argue that setting hiring, promotion and supplier diversity goals for underrepresented groups constitutes reverse discrimination. After Trump won a second term in November,Walmart joined the corporate pullback. Target’s suspension of its comparable DEI targets in January stung Black and LGBTQ+ customers harder, largely because they regarded the Minneapolis-based company asmore of a natural ally. The company said it would continue working with a diverse range of businesses. Philadelphia-based Pound Cake’s co-founders, Camille Bell and Johnny Velazquez, said they don’t think they would agree at this point if the retailer offered to stock their lipsticks and lip oils. “Target would have been a great boost to our business’s growth,” Velazquez said. “We’ll just find it elsewhere.” Target’s stance has created a dilemma for brand founders with existing distribution deals. One is Play Pits, a natural deodorant for children that Maryland resident Chantel Powell launched in 2021. The product is found in about 360 Target stores. The retailer’s DEI program “allowed us to employ amazing people, give back to our community, and exhibit Black excellence on and off the shelves,” Powell wrote on LinkedIn as civil rights leaders talked about boycotting Target. She and some other product creators highlighted the impact boycotts might have on their businesses. They urged upset customers to intentionally limit their purchases toitems from Black-owned enterprises. Some activists understood; others pushed the brands to join the protest by cutting ties with Target. “The conversation around Black brands, that they should pull out of the retailers that they’re in, is unrealistic,” Powell said this month asa 40-day, church-organizedTarget boycott was underway. “We signed up to be in business. I understand why people are having that conversation of boycotts. As a Black founder, I also understand the side of how it can be detrimental.” The owner of a Black-owned sexual wellness business with its own line of condoms has a slightly different take. Target started carrying B Condoms in 2020, and founder Jason Panda said the company told him late last year that it didn’t intend to keep the prophylactics in the 304 stores that stocked them. Panda says he isn’t worried. The product is available through Amazon and in more than 7,000 CVS stores, he said. What’s more, contracts with non-profit organizations and local governments that distribute condoms for free are the cornerstone of the business he established in 2011, Panda said. “My money has never really come from mainstream,” he said. “We’re going to be protected as long as I can maintain my relationship with my community.” Brianna Arps, who founded the fragrance brand Moodeaux in 2021, notices fewer grants available to Black brand creators these days. She used to apply for 10 to 15 every week or two; the number is down to five to seven, Arps said. “A lot of the organizations that had been really vocal about supporting (Black businesses) have either quietly or outwardly pulled back,” she said. Moodeaux was the first Black-owned perfume brand to get its perfumes into Urban Outfitters and Credo Beauty, which specializes in natural vegan products. Inthe current environment, Arps is looking to expand her brand’s presence independent shops and to support other Black fragrance lovers. “The resiliency of brands like ours and founders like myself will still exist,” she said. Aurora James, the founder of the Fifteen Percent Pledge, said nearly 30 major companies that joined the initiative remain committed to it, including Bloomingdale’s, beauty retailer Sephora, J. Crew and Gap. Ulta Beauty, another pledge signatory, and Credo Beauty carry Pound Cake products. Velazquez and Belle want to use social media to direct their followers to support retailers like Ulta and to bolster their online sales. “It’s going to be fostering the community that we have and growing that,” Velazquez said. While making a strategic decision “to appeal to a broader audience” when selecting puzzles for Barnes & Noble, Chambers said she plans to introduce Black faces and experiences to the chain’s bookstores over time, in boxes of 500, 750 and 1,000 pieces. In the meantime, Puzzles of Color expanded its “Pride” collection as a response to the DEI backlash. The subjects include Harriet Tubman, a mother and daughter tending a garden, and a little girl in a beauty supply store gazing up at hair accessories. “Do we lean in all the way?” Chambers asks herself. “Part of why we started this was because we didn’t see enough Black people in puzzles.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Let’s Go Compost via AP)                 NEW YORK (AP) — Lauren Click founded a nonprofit a few years ago offering freecomposting educationto schools around the country. Today, 112 schools participate, yet she can’t get her boyfriend to properly separate his trash at home in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Adults have moreset behaviors than young kids.I try to model a behavior and hopefully he does it,” said Click, executive director of her Let’s Go Compost organization. “But it’s also like, I’m not his parent. I’m not going to berate him every day or ruin my relationship over this. I just fish a bunch of stuff out of the trash.” Her efforts, which she calls 50-50 effective with her partner, point to an important question in the field of environmental psychology: What’sthe best approachwhen looking toinfluence colleagues, friends and family to live more sustainably? What’s the worst? Researchers say Click is on the right track. Modeling can work, though as with other approaches, it depends on who the sender is, how the message is framed and who it’s intended for. Here’s a look at some of the issues and strategies involved in making people more aware of their role inclimate change, which is caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline, coal and gas, and encouraging them to cut waste and protect the natural world.  Magnus Bergquist is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. His research focuses on how to persuade people to adopt more eco-friendly behavior. In a recent study reviewing studies in his area, Bergquist homed in on the influence of others. “What we found was the most effective strategy for changing behavior is social norms, pointing to what other people are doing or people’s perception of other people’s approval or disapproval,” he said. “But interestingly, when we ask people about the effectiveness of different interventions, people tend to say that social norms are among the least effective ones,” Bergquist added. The bottom line: Humans are generally social animals, which isn’t a surprise. But most people underestimate how much they’re influenced by social norms, and campaigns are often based on strategies that are less effective, he said. While Click is unlikely to pay off her boyfriend to do better, Bergquist saidfinancial incentivesor disincentives are the second most effective strategy (behind social norms) in getting people to take more sustainable steps in their lives. That covers everything from bonus cash in a community or office totax benefits, he said. But there’s a caveat. When people change their behavior because of financial incentives or disincentives, “some studies show that it crowds out people’s moral compass,” he said. “They will do it for the money. They won’t do it for the sake of the question as such.” Example: A popular way to promote pro-environmental behavior is holding a contest for something like conserving energy or riding your bike to work. “Ride your bike and a get a prize,” Bergquist explained. “What we see over and over again is that’s effective in the short term. When the prize or the contest is removed, people tend to go back.” Norah Hippolyte is the business manager for St. Mary Magdalen Parish in socially progressive Berkeley, California. She supplies table goods for workers and a wide range of group gatherings, from funerals and community dinners to functions for the parish’s school. For several years, she’s been trying to wean everyone ontocompostable plates, cups, bowls and utensils. “So I buy the stuff. I make sure people are aware I’ve got it in the closet, that that’s where I keep everything. I say, use this stuff. Make sure you let me know when people start to run low,” she said. “But people choose not to use what’s there. They’re using their own things, and it’s all regular plastic.” She tries to get them to rinse and recycle, or clean what’s cleanable so it can be used again. “When I started working in Berkeley, I figured everybody had this whole recycle thing down. Nooooo,” Hippolyte said. “Not only did I have to learn, I have to now try and teach people, OK, this bin is for this, this and this. That bin is for this. Sorting is the biggest issue.” Hippolyte’s experience doesn’t surprise Bergquist. “I always want to mention education — trying to inform people or educate people about issues — because that tends to be ineffective alone,” he said. Bergquist says those who have been talking themselves to death or shoveling facts into the faces of reluctant folks should add some other motivation. For example, when Sarah Davies was trying to convince her 16-year-old son to give up single-use plastics, she switched strategies. “He truly believed he canuse plastic as much as he likesand then put it into the recycling bin,” said Davies, who heads up communications for Earthday.org, organizers of the April 22Earth Day. “What finally made the difference was me explaining that when he’s drinking from a single-use plastic bottle, be it water or soda, he’s also drinking potentially 240,000 nanoparticles of plastics. That shocked him.” Bergquist noted that a couple of experiments have indicated that people pay more attention to negative information than positive information. “So instead of saying many people are pro-environmental, you can say people are avoiding environmentally harmful products,” he said. “It’s the avoidance.” It’s a small but potentially valuable tweak, Bergquist said. Take straws. “Instead of saying people are using paper straws, you might say most people areavoiding plastic straws. You don’t have to explain. People will find an explanation,” he said. Other expert tips for persuasion include picking your battles; starting small, focusing on one habit; appealing to the person’s interest in other benefits, like saving money or being more efficient; keeping it easy; and not forcing the issue.

Immigrant students and scholars are being detained at remote facilities in Louisiana over objections,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-detention-students-louisiana-bd46789bb7b295fa31b5d564673b9c2d,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File)       As U.S. authoritiescrack down on immigrantsat universities in a fervor against pro-Palestinian protests, they quickly have shuttled some of those detained to remote facilities in Louisiana. Lawyers forMahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student facing possible deportation for his role in protests at that campus, are calling his imprisonment in Louisiana a “Kafkaesque” attempt to chill free speech. Louisiana is emerging as a linchpin for immigrant detention in President Donald Trump’s second term, at facilities far from New Orleans and beyond the immediate reach of most rights groups and attorneys. Immigrant detention in Louisiana surged during Trump’s first term at facilities adapted from state prisons and local jails. At the time a statecriminal justice overhaulhad reduced the prison population, threatening the economies of small towns that rely on the lockups. Officials in rural parishes signed contracts for immigrant detention that guaranteed millions in payments to local governments. Immigrants and their advocates complained of prolonged detention, mistreatment and isolation, includingsolitary confinement that sometimes resulted in death. Louisiana is the No. 2 state today for immigrant detention by ICE, after Texas. About 7,000 immigrants are held there in civil detention, according to government data compiled by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.  The transfer of Khalil from the New York area to Louisiana complicates his legal fight to be released. An attorney for the Department of Justice, August Flentje, wants the dispute litigated in Louisiana “for jurisdictional certainty.” A judge in Newark, New Jersey, heard jurisdictional arguments Friday and plans to issue a written ruling. Immigration authorities are also holding30-year-old Turkish studentRumeysa Ozturk at a detention center in Basile, about 170 miles (270 kilometers) west of New Orleans. The Tufts University doctoral studentwas detainedby immigration officials as she walked along a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville on Tuesday and transferred to Louisiana before a federal judge ordered her kept in Massachusetts. Attorneys for another detained scholar, Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama, said Friday that he was likely to be sent to an ICE center in Jena, Louisiana, a town of about 5,000 that is also far from major cities. Doroudi, 32, initially was held at the Pickens County Jail in Carrollton, Alabama, after his arrest by immigration agents at his apartment in the middle of the night. Doroudi was picked up because a visa was revoked in 2023, and his attorneys say he never participated in campus protests. The Department of Homeland Security said Doroudi poses a “significant national security threat” but did not elaborate. Relatively few immigrants settle in Louisiana. Foreign-born residents there make up less than 5% of the population, compared with the national average of about 13%. Trump’s inauguration-day executive orders and promises ofmass deportationsof “millions and millions” of people hinge on securing more money for immigrant detention beds. The number of immigrants in ICE detention this month hit 47,892 — the highest since October 2019 — as the administration experiments with the use of offshore facilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba. Authorities also are using federal prisons to detain some people, returning to a strategy thatdrew allegations of mistreatmentduring Trum’s first term. The administration also recently resumed family detention of immigrants at a South Texas facility after a Biden-era pause.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/John Locher)               NEW YORK (AP) — Dana White squeezed in a recent workout in New York — ahead of the launch of hisnew boxing promotion, just after he struck a YouTube deal forPower Slap, days ahead of the next majorUFC pay-per-view cardand around the time he celebrated making the cover of Forbes — when his phone buzzed in the gym from one of his closest confidants, the president. Hours before President Donald Trump addressed Congress, he texted White congratulations on becoming the latest cover boy for the business magazine that labeled the UFC CEO the “Populist Capitalist.” Their relationship dates to UFC’s infancy in White’s reign as he reorganized the company and led its rise into national prominence. Their alliance has yielded dividends for both parties — White stumped for Trump at Republican conventions while men who soak up fight nights threw their support behind Trump in the elections. It’s that kinship that prompted Trump to text White after the cover was released and even take Forbes to task for publishing the president’s name in the sub-headline. “You deserve the cover without having absolutely nothing to do with Trump,” White said, as he read the text exchange to The Associated Press. “I shouldn’t even be mentioned in the scheme of your tremendous success, so much as mentioned.” Maybe, but perhaps it’s telling that Trump’s rise politically mirrors that of UFC’s ascendance under White, two men whose style has served as a siren song for a segment of the population yearning for a return to the so-called traditional definition of a virile man, not just in the ring, but in life.  Kyle Kusz, a University of Rhode Island professor and author of “Revolt of the White Athlete: Race, Media and the Emergence of Extreme Athletes in America,” said Trump smartly latched onto UFC because White has posited the company as a safe space for “manly men.” “It kind of embodies the brutal, fight-to-the-finish way of being a man,” Kusz said. “It seems open to all sorts of men across different social categories, whether that’s class, whether that’s ethnicity, whether that’s race. It’s also open to women who are willing to be all-in on that way of thinking. Trump is cultivating that way of being to essentially train the population to fight for his reign.” White was grateful in his text reply to Trump, writing, “When they mention tribal business model, it’s really about loyalty and friendship, which is something people these days know nothing about. You and I are the poster boys for loyalty. Thank you for the kind words, Mr. President. But I have no problem being mentioned with you in any shape or form.” Yes, that’s right, White calls his long-time friend and former business associate from the days when Boardwalk cards at Trump Taj Mahal lifted UFC into relevancy, Mr. President. “I called him Don before he became President,” White said, laughing. “Now that he became President, I call him Mr. President.” Now, White, already the king of combat sports, may soon be called the final boss in boxing. TKO Group, the company that already houses WWE and UFC, entered into a partnership with Saudi Arabian businessmen to form the new, yet unnamed boxing venture that could provide the jolt of cash, infrastructure, and organized leadership the sport needs. TKO will serve as managing partner and run the day-to-day operations of the promotion expected to run its first card next year, but details are scarce beyond the initial announcement. The league needs a name — TKO is literally the low-hanging fruit there for the taking — a roster and a rights deal. Given the business acumen of the parties involved, and the hefty Saudi bankroll, those issues seem easily solvable and White’s input might be enough to prop boxing out of its niche status and into a mainstream sports player. Boxing retreated from the public sports consciousness in part because White and UFC exploited its inherent messiness to create a more coherent fight organization. It was WWE president and TKO board member Nick Khan who introduced White to Turki Alalshikh, chairman of the Saudi General Entertainment Authority, about 18 months ago to discuss collaborating on a boxing league. White had toyed with the idea of starting a boxing promotion and trying to fix a sport many believe long broken because of everything from corruption to decaying interest in the United States to the alphabet soup sanctioning bodies refusing to play nice and book the best fights. The 55-year-old White hit it off with Alalshikh and Saudi Arabia was eager to add to its sports portfolio. The Saudishost a Formula 1 auto race, fundLIV Golf, have hosted numerous pay-per-viewboxing cards— topped by Tyson Fury’s win over Francis Ngannou inOctober 2023— are in the midst of a10-year dealto hold WWE events and will host the 2034 World Cup in men’s soccer, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet in its sports expansion. Each marquee event only seems to push accusations against Saudi Arabia of “sportswashing,”an effort to rebrand a nation’s troubling public image that has been going onfor decades, using the Olympics and other sports across the globe, further into the background. Endeavor (the majority owner of TKO) and CEO Ari Emanuelreturned a $400 million investmentfrom the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund in 2019 after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Now, TKO is working with, among others, Sela, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The Saudis will fund the league, while TKO will run it. “So far, it’s been a great relationship,” White said. “I have to be aligned. I have to feel good about the relationship and these guys have kept their world and did everything they said they would do. Anything that happened with Saudi, pre-my deal, I didn’t have a relationship, I wasn’t with them.” White and TKO have the tools to turn the company into a winner. White — whom Forbes estimated to have a personal net worth north of $600 million — has cashed in on the current political climate and an audience that embraces the extreme no-excuses ideological masculinity that ushered Trump into the White House. Trump has leaned on UFC fights as both testosterone-charged campaign rallies andelection celebrationsand White and his fighters have come along for the ride. “A lot of the ways in which Trump wants to change culture, and to win at politics, he can express through connecting himself through sport, like UFC, because it does kind of promote manly man who are willing to be strong, be aggressive who are willing to fight for their side,” Kusz said. Much like loyalists seemed to tune out impeachment charges against Trump or even hisconviction on 34 felony countsin his historic hush money trial, the murky ethos of being bad has never been so good inside UFC. UFC fighters can seemingly act however they want and say whatever they want — see fighterBryce Mitchell’s recent defense of Adolph Hitleror Conor McGregor’s order by a civil jury to pay $250,000 to a woman who sayshe raped her— without any significant consequence levied by the company. “This is the fight business, man,” White said. “And then when you talk about races, religions, whatever you are, whoever you are, that’s what I’m selling. This is the fight business. At the end of the day, get over it. And if you can’t get over it, here’s my solution to you, don’t watch it.” In American sports leagues, Mitchell and McGregor would have faced lengthy suspensions or more severe consequences for their actions, the kind of punishments White — who wouldn’t evensanction himselffor an incident with his wife — no longer worries about dishing out. “We went through that early on, figuring out where we fit, who we were and all that stuff. Not anymore,” he said. “This is the fight business. People are going to say some stupid (stuff). People that you won’t necessarily agree with. Some bad thing will break out in their part of the world, and you hold all of them accountable for it and they can’t make a living? That’s never going to be us while I’m here. After I’m gone, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen.” And how long does White plan to keep running his mixed martial arts empire? “Until I die,” he said.

US consumers remained cautious about spending last month as inflation ticked higher,https://apnews.com/article/economy-consumer-spending-tariffs-c8be092ecf06a81ad79c4c8f921c7cbe,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Unsold 2025 Countryman utility vehicles sit on display at a Mini dealership Sunday, March 23, 2025, in Highlands Ranch, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation picked up last month and consumers barely raised their spending, signs that the economy was already cooling even beforemost tariffswere imposed. Friday’sreportfrom the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices increased 2.5% in February from a year earlier, matching January’s annual pace. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.8% compared with a year ago, higher than January’s figure of 2.7%. Economists watch core prices because they are typically a better guide of where inflation is headed. The core index has barely changed in the past year. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, making it difficult for the central bank to cut its key interest rateanytime soon. The report also showed that consumer spending rebounded last month after falling by the most in four years in January. Yet much of the additional spending reflected price increases, with inflation-adjusted spending barely rising. The weak figure suggests growth is rapidly slowing in the first three months of this year as consumers and businesses turn cautious amid sharp changes in government policies. “Inflation too hot and spending too cold,” said Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm, in an email. “The Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates this year.” Brown estimates that economic growth could fall to zero in the first three months of this year,down from 2.4%in last year’s fourth quarter.  Inflation remains a top economic concern for most Americans, even as it has fallen sharply from its 2022 peak. Donald Trump rode dissatisfaction with higher prices to the presidency and promised to quickly bring down inflation, but the yearly rate is higher now than in September, when it briefly touched 2.1%. Consumer spending rose 0.4% in February, though the gain was just 0.1% after adjusting for prices. The mild increase follows a sharp 0.6% drop in January. The spending and inflation figures steepened a market downturn early Friday. The broad S&P 500 stock market index fell 1.4%. The Dow Jones index fell more than 500 points and the Nasdaq fell as well. The spending increase was driven by greater purchases of long-lasting goods, such as cars and appliances, which could reflect an effort by shoppers to buy things before tariffs are imposed. They are the kind of purchases that won’t likely be repeated in coming months. Spending on services, including discretionary spending such as at restaurants and hotels, fell. “The fact that consumers chose to increase outlays on goods that are about to see price increases at the expense of the far more economically important service sector provides insight into the mindset of the consumer,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at tax and advisory firm RSM. Also Friday, the University of Michigan released itsupdated consumer sentiment surveyfor March, which showed a sharp drop in Americans’ outlook for the economy. The survey also found growing anxiety over inflation and jobs. “This month’s decline reflects a clear consensus across all demographic and political affiliations,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey. “Republicans joined independents and Democrats in expressing worsening expectations since February for their personal finances, business conditions, unemployment, and inflation.” Trump has slapped 20%tariffs on all Chinese imports, 25% import taxes on steel and aluminum, and on Wednesday said he would hit imported cars with another 25% duty. Most economists, and the Federal Reserve, now expect inflation to tick higher this year as a result of the tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week said elevated inflation from the tariffscould be temporary. But he also added the outlook was unusually uncertain given the swift changes in policy from the White House. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% in February from the previous month, the same as in January, while core prices increased 0.4%, the largest increase in more than a year. Increases at that pace, for a full year, would drive inflation far above the Fed’s 2% target. One bright spot in the report was a big jump in incomes for the second straight month — they rose 0.8% in February from January. Higher income with weaker spending pushed up the savings rate, which can fuel future spending. But it also could reflect greater caution among consumers. “Savings went up, consistent with reports of flagging consumer confidence, rising uncertainty about the future and reduced expectations for the future,” Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said. Consumer and business confidence in the economy has fallen sharply since Trump began rolling out tariffs, and a measure of Americans’ outlook for the future of the economy dropped to a12-year low on Tuesday.Many polls find that most of the public sees the economy as fair or poor. A survey last month by the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Americans still see inflation as a “very big problem.” Apparel company Lululemon on Thursday became the latest retailer to warn that slumping consumer confidence will hurt sales, while the parent company of Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Johnny Was stores said that sales slowed to start the year as consumer sentiment darkened. Nike previously issued a similar warning and expectations from major retailers like Target and Walmart have grown subdued as customers pull back.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Sewage sludge can find a second life on farm fields. Here’s how it’s made,https://apnews.com/article/human-waste-sewage-sludge-farm-fertilizer-how-it-works-05d3656b76223b54b3e14fe0831dd875,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. What goes down your toilet can end up on farm fields across the United States.  Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.  But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. Arecent studyreleased by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.  The amount of these “forever chemicals” that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.  “They are very widespread,” said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they’re not in all biosolids and sometimes it’s only in small amounts, he added.   At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.    After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.     The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.    The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.    After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’sregulations for land-applied biosolids.  “There are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,” including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.    Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.  The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what’s in the water. In addition to human waste, biosolids might contain all kinds of everyday household chemicals like beauty products and pharmaceuticals, some of which may contain forever chemicals, Prasse added. At the Columbus facility, the majority of their waste comes from households and businesses.  The Columbus facility tests the final product for metals and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen every month even when they are being stored before land application.    In Columbus, the city takes half of these dirt-like biosolids to a composting facility nearby, where they are mixed with other organic material like trees and leaves and turned into compost after an additional round of heating and aeration to further kill off pathogens. These biosolids are less regulated and can be used on land such as parks or a residential yard.  The Columbus facility, like most such operations, doesn’t test the incoming material for PFAS, an expensive proposition. Dixon said any future testing or treatment of wastewater for PFAS at his facility would depend on future federal regulations.  ——  Follow Joshua A.

Pilgrims have been pouring into a medieval hilltop town to venerate not only two of the Catholic Church’s most celebrated saints, Francis and Clare, but its newest – Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint, who will be canonized in a month on April 27.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)      Carlo Acutiswill become the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint at a solemn canonization Mass on April 27 in St. Peter’s Square. Butthrongs of pilgrims are already flockingto the church in Assisi, Italy, where his body wearing sneakers, jeans and a sweatshirt lies in a shrine. Here’s more on the teenage boy who’s generating uncommon devotion. Carlo Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy Italian family, and grew up in Milan. His precocious faith journey took off after he received First Communion at the young age of 7, and he regularly attended daily Mass, prayed the rosary and participated ineucharistic adoration. While he enjoyed regular pastimes for his age — hiking, video games, and joking around with friends – he also taught catechism in a local parish and did outreach to the homeless. Acutis used his computer savvy to create an online exhibit about more than 100 eucharistic miracles recognized by the church over many centuries, focused on the real presence of Christ that Catholics believe is in the consecrated bread and wine. In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill. Ten days later, he died of acute leukemia at a hospital in northern Italy. His body was later transferred to an Assisi cemetery as Acutis had asked, because of his devotion tothe hometown medieval saint, St. Francis.  His road to sainthood — the canonization process — started more than 10 years ago at the initiative of a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly afterPope Francisbegan his papacy in 2013. Acutis was named “venerable” in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in Assisi’s Santuario della Spogliazione, a major site linked to St. Francis’ life. He was then declared “blessed” in 2020 after the Vatican dicastery that studies sainthood processes recognized a miraculous healing through Acutis’ intercession — a child in Brazil who recovered in a “scientifically inexplainable” manner. Last year, the church paved his way to sainthood by attributing to him a second miracle — the complete healing of a Costa Rican student in Italy from major head trauma in a bicycle accident after her mother prayed at Acutis’ tomb. Acutis’ canonization Mass will be Sunday, April 27, at 10:30 a.m. in front of the Vatican’s St. Peter Basilica, in conjunction with the celebration of theHoly Year’sjubilee for teens. The Rev. Domenico Sorrentino, Assisi’s bishop, said that over the last year, a million pilgrims made their way to Acutis’ shrine in this medieval hilltop town in central Italy. Images of Acutis, usually portraying him with a backpack and smiling broadly, are in shops all over town, from pocket-sized cards to statuettes. A religious souvenir shop near the Vatican recently displayed in its window a near-life-sized statue of Acutis next to one ofMother Teresa of Kolkata. To many pilgrims, the draw is Acutis’ relatability as a teen of this time. “It’s amazing this saint, a young person — we can propose him to our people to imitate because everybody can be a saint,” said Rev. Jacinto Bento, a Portuguese priest who was leading a group of 30 jubilee pilgrims from the Azores islands to Assisi earlier this month. The same day, Tomaso Barbon of Treviso, in northern Italy, was visiting the shrine with his wife and three children, two of them teens. “He appears like one of our kids,” Barbon said of Acutis. “A special prayer to him is really welcome.” Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’scollaborationwith The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Eric Henderson, who led South Dakota State to two NCAA Tournament appearances in six seasons, has been hired as Drake’s head coach, the school announced Friday. The 46-year-old Henderson replaces Ben McCollum, wholeft for Iowa on Mondayafter leading the Bulldogs to the Missouri Valley Conference regular-season and tournament championships and afirst-round win over Missouriin the NCAA Tournament. “My family and I are elated to join Drake Nation,” Henderson said. “Early on in this process it became evident that values and vision aligned with the incredible path President (Marty) Martin and (athletic director) Brian Hardin have already established. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity they have given me and my family to walk that path with them. The excitement for Drake basketball is at an all-time high, and I’m looking forward to building relationships and representing such a committed university and fan base.” Henderson is a native of Coggon, Iowa, about 140 miles northeast of Drake’s campus in Des Moines. He played at Wayne State in Nebraska under current Creighton coach Greg McDermott and worked as a coach at the high school and college levels before he was hired as a South Dakota State assistant in 2014. He was hired as the Jackrabbits’ coach in 2019, after current Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger left for UNLV, and was 129-60 overall and 76-20 in Summit League play. Henderson’s squads never finished worse than third in the Summit League and won at least a share of the regular-season title four times. His 2022 and 2024 teams lost first-round games in the NCAA Tournament. “Eric quickly established himself in a talented pool of candidates as the best person to lead our men’s basketball program,” Hardin said. “He elevated South Dakota State to not only the premier program in the Summit League but also one of the best programs at our level in the country.”  AP March Madness bracket:https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracketand coverage:https://apnews.com/hub/march-madnessGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Music Review: Jessie Reyez returns in triumph with ‘Paid in Memories’,https://apnews.com/article/jessie-reyez-paid-memories-review-7055f1e389fbc748b486cc1acfaf3f9e,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This album cover image released by Island Records shows “Paid in Memories” by Jessica Reyez. (Island Records via AP) This album cover image released by Island Records shows “Paid in Memories” by Jessie Reyez. (Island Records via AP)     Most artists would make the first song on their new album something welcoming, trendy or pleasing, at least to make the Spotify algorithm happy. NotJessie Reyez. She crafted a song with clear red flags — “I Never Said I Was Sane” — a totally bananas opening cut that includes screaming, taunting, religious texts, whispering, heavy distortion, a little flute and a babyish pout. “Lost some screws along the way to L.A.,” she sings. That’s why Reyez is always a glorious sonic handful and why the album “Paid in Memories” is another of her messy triumphs. Think of her as the anti-Tate McRae. The Toronto-bred musician is a magpie of an artist, taking a little from hip-hop here, dipping into some alt-rock on another, using a cool soul lick or a Latin beat. If you know where the next song is taking you, you’re lying. She can go from purring along to a plunky guitar to feet-planted battle rapping, even in the same song. Reyez, who in the past leaned on co-writers, this time often supplies the music and lyrics alone, a sign of her continuing maturity and control. Few artists could accommodate such varied big-name guests asLil Wayne,Miguel, 6lack, Lil Yachty, Deyaz, Big Sean andAri Lennox.Each time, she makes it work on her terms. One song — “Couldn’t Be Me” — features Sam Smith, and you might expect to hear their voices swirling together in a melodic, naughty club banger. Instead, Reyez sings a melancholy ballad of lost love, with the last minute taken up by a touching voicemail by Smith sending her encouragement after the breakup.  There’s often a bite to Reyez’s songs so it’s refreshing to hear unalloyed sincerity on “Goliath,” a pure love song: “You love me like a Sunday morning/But you kiss me like a Friday night.” There’s also the fun dance-pop “NYB” (for “New York baby”) which has the vibe of a hysterically low-rent “American Boy” by Estelle (she lands in Newark and is picked up by her lover in a truck). “Jeans” with Miguelis destined to be one of the sexiest songs of 2025 (“Cause you fit/Better than a pair of jeans, baby”) and “Psilocybin & Daisies,” lifts from “1979” performed by The Smashing Pumpkins, terrifically. Who samples from the Pumpkins? She and6lackextend their long, fruitful collaborations — this time she accommodatingly stylizes the song “6lessings” for him as their styles swirl perfectly — and she gets slinky with the murky dance track “Palo Santo.” Reyez gets very personal at times — her estrangements with her brother is the topic of a song — and on “Been Abouta Year” takes stock of her life: “Where’s the famous silver lining I was promised?/To be honest/Life is falling kinda short.” You and us all, sister. Just glad you’re here. More AP reviews:https://apnews.com/hub/music-reviews   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Photo by Alberto Pezzali/Invision/AP)          NEW YORK (AP) — It wasn’tthe night punk broke,but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, theSex Pistols— then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock — performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash. The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights. Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols — Jones, Cook and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) — sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. “This is where it all kicked off, really,all the punk,”says Cook. This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined byJohn Lydon (formerly Rotten.)The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas — the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978. Jones recalls having “pigs’ hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.” It is one of a few dates featured in three “Live in the U.S.A.” albums, documenting the band’s ’78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.  “We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,” Jones jokes. The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 atthe Hollywood Palladiumin Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later. Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3.Tickets go on saleApril 4 at 10 a.m. local time. They will perform the band’s sole album, 1977’s “Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols Album” live in its entirety as well as other material. So, why tour the U.S. andCanadanow? “Why not?” says Jones. “I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,” says Carter. “And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.” “At the end of the day, we’re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,” he continued. “Punk is an energetic music. It’s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs’ hooves.” Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour. “The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,” says Jones, referring toa previous lawsuitbetween the singer and the band over music use intheir TV series “Pistol.”The judge ruled against Lydon’s opposition. “We wish him the best,” Jones said. “Good luck to him,” adds Matlock. “I wish he thinks, maybe, ‘good luck’ to us. Probably doesn’t. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can’t see many missed calls from him.” As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn’t expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance. “We’re a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,” says Matlock. “And I think that’s something that’s got a great deal of aplomb that we’re going to bring to the public over there.” Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? “It’s early days,” says Jones. “Let’s see what happens.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Got your first job? Here are some tax tips for first-time filers,https://apnews.com/article/tax-season-tips-first-time-filers-graduates-9489cd51a45e5a41e51f6f89bb401c39,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A page from the Internal Revenue Service website is shown on a laptop on Monday, April1, 2024 in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, file) This March 22, 2013, file photo shows the exterior of the Internal Revenue Service building in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)     NEW YORK (AP) — The deadline to file yourtaxesis less than a month away, and if you’re doing them for the first time, you might be feeling added pressure. “It’s an incredibly daunting and stressful experience for many of them,” said Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant based California. Planning ahead, doing your research and talking with experts can help first-time filers feel better abouttheir taxes, Ringbauer said. The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is April 15. If you run out of time, you can file for anextensionuntil Oct. 15. The extension is only to file your taxes, not to pay them. If you think you will owe taxes, you should pay an estimated amount before the deadline to avoid paying penalties and interest. If you expect to receive a refund, you will still get your money when you file your taxes. Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes for the first time: The first step is to gather all the relevant documentation, said Eva Simpson, vice president of Member Value, Tax & Advisory Services for the American Institute of CPAs. “Tracking down documentation is key, especially if they may be in college and have correspondence sent to their parents house,” Simpson said. Ringbauer also recommends that you make a folder, either physical or electronic, with all of the documents you need so it’s easier to file your taxes. While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs:  — Social Security number — W-2 forms, if you are employed — 1099-G, if you are unemployed — 1099 forms, if you are self-employed — Savings and investment records — Any eligible deduction, such as educational expenses, medical bills, charitable donations, etc. — Tax credits, such as child tax credit, retirement savings contributions credit, etc. Many young adults are still receiving some financial help from their parents when they’re ready to file their taxes for the first time. It’s important that first-time filers communicate with their parents in case they are being claimed as dependents, Simpson said. “Being claimed as a dependent affects their standard deduction and eligibility for certain credits,” said Simpson. Having a conversation with your parents will prevent you from claiming tax credits that you might not qualify for if they claim you as a dependent. If your parents claim you as a dependent, you will add this information to your tax return. Knowing if you are eligible for any tax credits and deductions is a crucial step when filing your taxes, Simpson said. Tax credits can lower the amount of taxes you owe or increase the amount of your refund. Some relevant tax credits for first-time filers include the American Opportunity tax credit and the Earned Income credit. When it comes todeductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $14,600 for a single filer and $29,200 for a married couple. “In many cases, first-time filers won’t need to be itemizing their expenses,” said Simpson. Doing research or asking a professional for the types of deductions and tax credits you qualify for can save you money, If you freelance, work in rideshare or sell your clothes online in addition to your part- or full-time job, you must add this income to your tax returns, said Tim McGrath, a certified financial planner based in Chicago. Forgetting to add tax income from freelance work in your tax documents is a common mistake by young filers, Ringbauer said. Some gig workers receive 1099 forms from their employers while others don’t, but both must document their income and expenses so they can be added to their tax returns. Simpson recommends that first-time filers look into the multiple resources available to file taxes for free or at a low cost. One of the is the newDirect File program, which allows people in 25 states who have very simple W-2s to calculate and submit their returns directly to the IRS for free. Aside from Direct File, IRS offersfree guided tax preparationthat does the math for you. This is available for people who make $79,000 or less per year. If you have questions while working on your tax forms, the IRS also offers aninteractive tax assistanttool that can provide answers based on your information. The AARP also offers atax-aid locatorwhere you can search for tax assistance near you. Mistakes can happen to everybody, but deliberately ignoring income can have more consequences, Ringbauer said. In general, if you make a mistake our you’re missing something in your tax return, the IRS will audit you, which means they will ask you for more documentation. A common mistake is failing to declare a source of income such as gig work or selling products online, said Ringbauer. This, he said, should be taken very seriously. “One of the biggest challenges is not taking it seriously, not caring about the nuances,” Ringbauer said. “It has to be accurate and exact information whether you self prepare or you’re doing it with a professional, because life is exact.” If you need to correct an error in a tax return you already filed, you can file an amended return. It’s always good practice to keep a record of your tax returns, just in case the IRS audits you for an item you reported years ago, Ringbauer said. TheIRS recommendsthat you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation. Ringbauer recommends that his clients keep records of their tax documents in a digital folder on a cloud platform of their choosing. Password-protecting your tax folders can also add an extra layer ofprotection against scammers.

"A new Chili’s near Scranton will be a throwback to ‘The Office,’ ‘awesome blossom’ and all",https://apnews.com/article/office-chilis-scranton-2faea0e7841dcd6903a798064fd17508,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Chili’s is opening a new restaurant just north of Scranton to honor the legacy of the show, “The Office.” The new Chili’s will have a mid-2000s theme and will bring back the “awesome blossom,” an onion dish celebrated on the show but long discontinued by the chain. It has been nearly two decades since the workplace mockumentary“The Office”first set an episode inside a Chili’s, where Michael Scott handed out Dundie awards to his ever-tolerant employees, including trophies for the whitest sneakers and for stinking up the bathroom. Over nine seasons, “The Office” regularly name-dropped real places and products associated with Scranton, where the Emmy-winning show was set. There’s the big pirate ship restaurant known as Cooper’s Seafood House and Poor Richard’s Pub inside a bowling alley. But in 2005, there was no Chili’s in the Pennsylvania city. So, at last, the chain is filling a hole in Office lore by opening a Chili’s in Dickson City, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) north of Scranton. This undated photo provided by Chili’s, shows actors Brian Baumgartner, left, who played Kevin Malone, and Kate Flannery, who played Meredith Palmer in the TV series “The Office,” posing in a soon-to-be opened Chili’s in Dickson City, Pa. (Ben Rosenzweig, Chili’s via AP)  The restaurant will be decorated as it would have been in the mid-2000s with old signs and chalkboard art. It will also feature direct nods to the show’s fictitious paper company, Dunder Mifflin. In one episode, Scott, played by Steve Carell, orders an awesome blossom — a deep-fried onion with a cheese dipping sauce — while trying to win a new client over lunch at Chili’s. That item, long struck from the Chili’s menu nationwide, is being reintroduced in the Scranton-area restaurant only. The new Chili’s will open April 7, when a “Scranton marg” will be available nationwide for the day. Two Office actors are appearing in commercials for the restaurant: Brian Baumgartner, who played the dimwitted accountant Kevin Malone; and Kate Flannery, whose character Meredith Palmer was a party-loving divorced mother working in supplier relations. Other actors, including Melora Hardin, Andy Buckley and Amy Pietz, also feature in a promotional video. “It seems like a wrong was righted here at around the 20th anniversary of the show to finally have a Scranton branch of Chili’s,” Baumgartner told The Associated Press.  A mural of Dwight Schrute is seen in Scranton, Pa., Tuesday, March 25, 2025. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Decades ago, when word got out that an American version of the British show “The Office” would center on Scranton, some locals feared their hometown would be the butt of the joke. The Rust Belt town had its heyday generations earlier with anthracite coal mining and steam trains. The show wound up celebrating Scranton and the characters, not poking fun at them, Baumgartner said. A life-sized Dundie Award is displayed in Scranton City Hall’s entryway, Tuesday, March 25, 2025, in Scranton, Pa. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  Flannery, who is from Philadelphia, said she’s happy “The Office” helped to reinforce local pride in the city. Scranton has hostedlarge Office parties, including one that drew many cast members and some 10,000 people around the 2013 series finale. Streaming services have boosted the show’s popularity. “It’s kind of like what Pam Beesly says in the last episode: there’s beauty in ordinary things. And Scranton can feel ordinary to some people,” Flannery told the AP. “But it’s really special. It really is.” The show banked on residents and businesses to donate Scranton swag, and gave shout-outs to local landmarks. John Krasinski, who played Jim Halpert, filmed scenes for the opening montage in Scranton, making the city’s Penn Paper tower recognizable around the world. The “Scranton welcomes you” sign from Krasinski’s footage was moved to a downtown mall because people kept stopping on a highway to take photos. This undated image released by Chili’s shows actors Andy Buckley, from left, Melora Hardin and Amy Pietz, who appeared in the TV series “The Office,” posing at a soon-to-be opened Chili’s in Dickson City, Pa. (Chili’s via AP)  For Chili’s, building a themed eatery that is expected to draw tourists isn’t the normal course of business, said George Felix, Chili’s chief marketing officer. In 2005, the nearest Chili’s was about 19 miles (30 kilometers) away from Scranton. It has since closed. “Given the ties that this brand has to Scranton, this one was definitely special for us,” Felix told the AP. Baumgartner, who analyzed the show in a podcast and book, said the new Chili’s calls back to a crucial episode — The Dundies — that kicked off Season 2, Baumgartner said. “We were a failing show, quite frankly, with really bad ratings that first season and barely got brought back for a second,” Baumgartner said. “But some tonal things were changed. We decided to open that second season with kind of a bang, and left the office for the first time.” In that episode, Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, won the “whitest sneakers” Dundie and declared tipsily, “I feel God in this Chili’s tonight.” Pam was subsequently banned from Chili’s nationwide for stealing people’s drinks. In 2017, Chili’s pardoned the character, saying she was welcome back. “It’s going to feel like they’re actually on the show because it’s going to look exactly the same,” Flannery said of the Scranton-area Chili’s. “So it’s like a fan destination. It’s kind of awesome.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

If the first half of the Sweet 16 is any indication, the second half will be elite. The East and West regional finals are set after some scintillating performances on Thursday. The nets in Newark, New Jersey, may have to be replaced after Alabama broke the NCAA Tournament record with 25 3-pointersin a 113-88 blowout of BYU. Mark Sears led the Tide, hitting 10 3s while scoring 35 points. The Crimson Tide will face Duke and fabulous freshman Cooper Flagg, who set up a showdown between the East Region’s top two seeds with a stellar all-around performance in theBlue Devils’ 100-93 winover Arizona. Florida wasn’t too shabby on offense, either, running away fromMaryland 88-71. The Gators will need all the offense they can muster against stingy Texas Tech, which rallied from a 16-point deficit tobeat Arkansas 85-83in overtime. Next up are the South and Midwest regional semifinals on Friday. Buckle up. Tennessee vs. Kentucky, Indianapolis. The Southeastern Conference rivals have played 242nd times over 115 years, yet this will be their first meeting in the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats solved one of the nation’s top 3-point defenses in winning the two regular-season meetings, hitting 12 from beyond the arc both times. The Vols have been superb defensively through the first two games of the NCAA Tournament, holding teams to an average of 60 points. Auburn vs. Michigan, Atlanta.

Usha Vance attends a campaign rally, Nov. 1, 2024, in Selma, N.C. (AP Photo/Allison Joyce, File)   The pointed remarks came as Vance visited U.S. troops on Pituffik Space Base on the mineral-rich,strategically critical islandalongside his wife and other senior U.S. officials for a trip that was ultimately scaled back afteran uproar among Greenlanders and Daneswho were not consulted about the original itinerary.  “Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,” Vance said. “You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change.”  Vance said the U.S. has “no option” but to take a significant position to ensure the security of Greenland as he encouraged a push in Greenland for independence from Denmark.  “I think that they ultimately will partner with the United States,” Vance said. “We could make them much more secure. We could do a lot more protection. And I think they’d fare a lot better economically as well.”  The reaction by members of Greenland’s parliament and residents has rendered that unlikely, with anger erupting over the Trump administration’s attempts to annex the vast Arctic island. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pushed back on Vance’s claim that Denmark isn’t doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country “a good and strong ally.”   Soon after arriving, Vance briefly addressed U.S. troops stationed at the base as he and his wife sat down to lunch with them, saying that the Trump administration is very interested in “Arctic security.” He and his entourage, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, later received briefings from military officials.   A fisherman rides on a boat though a frozen sea inlet outside of Nuuk, Greenland, Thursday, March 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)   It was minus-3 degrees F (minus-19 degrees C) when the delegation landed at the remote base 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) north of the Arctic Circle. “It’s cold as s—- here. Nobody told me,” Vance said, prompting laughs.  Therevised tripto the semi-autonomous Danish territory comes asrelations between the U.S. and the Nordic country, a traditional U.S. ally and NATO member, have soured. Trump had repeatedly suggested that the United States should in some form control the island.  During his remarks at the end of the brief visit, Vance underscored that he did not think military force was ever going to be necessary as he pressed the idea of a dramatically enhanced American position on the island.  “Because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we’re going to have to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America,” Vance said while adding that the people of Greenland had the right to determine their own future.  In Washington, Trump on Friday said the U.S. “needs Greenland for international security.”  Trump, speaking to reporters soon after Vance’s arrival, alluded to the rising Chinese and Russian interest in the Arctic, where sea lanes have opened up because of climate change.  “Greenland’s very important for the peace of the world,” Trump said. “And I think Denmark understands, and I think the European Union understands it. And if they don’t, we’re going to have to explain it to them.”  After Vance’s speech, Frederiksen said Denmark was increasing its defense capabilities in the region, including new Arctic ships and long-range drones.  With Greenland part of NATO, she also emphasized the collective responsibility of the alliance to defend the Arctic in response to the Russian threat. After Denmark stood “side by side with Americans” in its war against terror, she said it was “not a fair way” for Vance to refer to Denmark.  Denmark’s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper Møller Sørensen, thanked Vance “for taking a closer look at Arctic security” and said both countries agree more could be done.  “Greenland & Denmark share a desire to strengthen our already incredibly close ties with our friend & ally,” he wrote on social media.  Ahead of Vance’s arrival, four of the five parties elected to Greenland’s parliament earlier this month signed an agreement to form a new, broad-basedcoalition government. The parties banded together in the face of Trump’s designs on the territory.  “It is a time when we as a population are under pressure,” the prime minister-designate, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said before the accord was signed to applause and cheers in the capital, Nuuk.  He added that “we must stick together. Together we are strongest,” Greenland broadcaster KNR reported.  In a post on Instagram, Frederiksen congratulated Nielsen and his incoming government, and said, “I look forward to close cooperation in an unnecessarily conflict-filled time.”  Frederiksen said Tuesday that the U.S. visit, which was originally set for three days, created “unacceptable pressure.” She has said Denmark wants to work with the U.S. on defense and security, but Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.  Initially, Vance’s wife, Usha Vance, had announced a solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. The vice president subsequently said he wouldjoin her on that trip, only to change that itinerary again — after protests from Greenland and Denmark — to a one-day visit to the military post only.  Inhabitants of Nuuk, which is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) south of Pituffik, voiced concern about Vance’s visit and the U.S. interest in their island.  Cora Høy, 22, said Vance was “welcome if he wants to see it but of course Greenland is not for sale.” She added that “it’s not normal around here” with all the attention Greenland is getting. “I feel now every day is about (Trump) and I just want to get away from it.” A boat rides though a frozen sea inlet outside of Nuuk, Greenland, March 6, 2025.

Of course the population here is a bit shook up,” said 30-year-old Inuk Kristensen. “My opinion is the same as everyone’s: Of course you don’t do things this way. You don’t just come here and say that you want to buy the place.”  As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.   “We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic, because we know that if America doesn’t, other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind,” Vance said.

(South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File)           COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina death row inmate on Friday chose execution byfiring squad, just five weeks after the state carried out its first death by bullets. Mikal Mahdi, who pleaded guilty to murder for killing a police officer in 2004, is scheduled to be executed April 11. Mahdi, 41, had the choice of dying by firing squad, lethal injection or the electric chair. He will be the first inmate to be executed in the state sinceBrad Sigmonchose to be shot to death on March 7. A doctor pronounced Sigmon dead less than three minutes after three bullets tore into his heart. “Faced with barbaric and inhumane choices, Mikal Mahdi has chosen the lesser of three evils,” one of his lawyers, David Weiss, said in a statement. “Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney.” Mahdi ambushed Orangeburg public safety officer James Myers at the officer’s shed in Calhoun County in July 2004. Myers had just returned from an out-of-town birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said. Myers’ wife found his burned body, shot at least eight times including twice in the head, in the shed that had been the backdrop for their wedding less than 15 months earlier, authorities said. Mahdi will be strapped to a chair 15 feet (4.6 meters) from three prison employees who volunteered to be on the firing squad. A target will be placed on his chest. Their rifles will all be loaded with a live round that shatters when it hits his rib cage.  Aside from Sigmon, only three other U.S. inmates — all in Utah — have been killed by a firing squad in the past 50 years. Sigmon was the first inmate killed by bullets in the U.S. since 2010. Mahdi’s lawyers have fileda final appealwith the state’s highest court, saying Mahdi’s case for a life sentence at his original trial took only 30 minutes and that his lawyers failed to call anyone who could testify on his behalf. It “didn’t even span the length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,” they said. Several defense lawyer organizations have filed briefs saying no one should be executed after such little effort to defend them. Mahdi’s lawyers said that as a juvenile Mahdi spent months in isolation in prison and that this altered his developing brain and affected his judgement. After Mahdi pleaded guilty to murder, Judge Clifton Newman said he sentenced the young man to death because a sense of humanity he tried to find in every defendant seemed not to exist in Mahdi. Prosecutors responded to the claim of a poor defense by saying Mahdi was able to present much more evidence during a 2011 appeal that had to be heard inside a prison because Mahdi had stabbed a death row guard during in an escape attempt. A judge rejected the appeal. “In Mahdi’s vernacular, if his mitigation presentation before Judge Newman ‘didn’t even span the length of a Law & Order episode,’ the review of any potential error is in its 24th season,” the state Attorney General’s Office wrote in court papers. Prosecutors said a lot of the new evidence would help Mahdi’s case, including a string of attacks and threats on prison employees; his guilty plea to killing a convenience store clerk in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, before the South Carolina killing; and two other deaths that authorities in Virginia think he may be connected to. “The nature of the man is violence,” prosecutors wrote. Mahdi has one more opportunity to live — he can ask Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life in prison without parole just minutes before his scheduled execution at 6 p.m. on April 11 at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. But no South Carolina governor hasoffered clemencyin the 47 executions in the state since the death penalty resumed in the U.S. in 1976. In the past seven months, South Carolina has executedFreddie Owenson Sept. 20;Richard Mooreon Nov. 1;Marion Bowman Jr.on Jan. 31; and Sigmon.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Robert Willett/The News & Observer via AP, File)     WASHINGTON (AP) — A judge challenging the outcome of his North Carolina Supreme Court race was photographed wearing Confederate military garb and posing before a Confederate battle flag when he was a member of a college fraternity that glorified the pre-Civil War South.  The emergence of the photographs comes at a delicate time for Jefferson Griffin, a Republican appellate judge who is seeking a spot on North Carolina’s highest court. Griffin, 44, is facing mounting criticism – including from some Republicans – as he seeks toinvalidate over 60,000 votes cast in last November’s election, a still undecided contest in which he is trailing the Democratic incumbent by over 700 votes. Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for the N.C. Supreme Court listens to testimony in Wake County Superior Court on Friday, February 7, 2025 in Raleigh, N.C. (Robert Willett/The News & Observer via AP, File)   The photographs, which were obtained by The Associated Press, are from when Griffin was a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1999-2003 and amember of the Kappa Alpha Order, one of the oldest and largest fraternities in the U.S., with tens of thousands of alumni.  Griffin said he regretted donning the Confederate uniform, which was customary during the fraternity’s annual “Old South” ball.  “I attended a college fraternity event that, in hindsight, was inappropriate and does not reflect the person I am today,” Griffin said in a statement. “At that time, like many college students, I did not fully grasp such participation’s broader historical and social implications. Since then, I have grown, learned, and dedicated myself to values that promote unity, inclusivity, and respect for all people.”   One of the pictures, taken during the 2001 ball, shows Griffin and roughly two-dozen other fraternity members clad in Confederate uniforms. Another photograph from the spring of 2000 shows Griffin and other Kappa Alpha brothers in front of a large Confederate flag. He served in 2002 as his chapter’s president.      Kappa Alpha has proven to be a lightning rod for controversy over the decades, often due to the racist or insensitive actions of some of its members. A number of politicians have been forced to apologize for having worn Confederate costumes at the fraternity’s functions or for being photographed in front of a Confederate flag.  Griffin said Friday he voted in favor of a resolution prohibiting Kappa Alpha members from displaying the rebel battle flag at the group’s national convention in 2001. The fraternity didn’t ban the wearing of the Confederate uniforms until nearly a decade later, long after Griffin graduated.  “We believe in cultural humility, we respect the best parts of our organization’s history, and through education we challenge our members to work for a better future. These things are not mutually exclusive,” said Jesse Lyons, a spokesman for Kappa Alpha’s national office in Lexington, Virginia. Have a news tip?

Lee as its “spiritual founder” and long championed the Southern “Lost Cause,” a revisionist view of history that romanticizes the Confederacy and portrays the Civil War as a valiant struggle for “states’ rights” unrelated to the enslavement of Black people. In decades past, some Kappa Alpha chapters referred to themselves as a “klan,” a term that many viewed as an unsubtle wink to the Ku Klux Klan.  The photographs featuring Griffin were taken at a time when many other Kappa Alpha chapters were reevaluating their celebration of the Confederacy.  During Griffin’s time in the fraternity, some in his chapter questioned the appropriateness of dressing up in Confederate uniforms for the ball. Griffin opposed abandoning the tradition, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. The uniforms stayed.  Griffin said he would “not respond to unsubstantiated comments based on memories of 20-plus years past.”  In high school Griffin also expressed an affinity for Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who led southern forces during the Civil War. In a 1998 feature on high school “scholars of the week” in The News & Observer of Raleigh newspaper, Griffin said Lee was his No. 1 choice to include on an “ideal guest list” for a party.      The Kappa Alpha Order was founded in 1865, not long after Lee surrendered to the Union Army, at a Virginia college where Lee served as president. At least one of the first members was a former rebel soldier who had served under Lee, who is revered by the fraternity as the ideal of gentlemanly Southern chivalry.  For more than a century, Kappa Alpha threw “Old South” parties. They were formal affairs where the Confederate battle flag was flown and fraternity brothers dressed in replica Confederate gray uniforms and their dates wore antebellum-style hoop skirts. Sometimes they would ride through campus on horseback.  Some Kappa Alpha chapters, particularly in the South, clung to their traditions, including the wearing of blackface, even as they drew protests and public sentiment shifted.  A Kappa Alpha “Old South” parade at Alabama’s Auburn University in 1992 drew supporters waving Confederate battle flags, as well as counter protesters who burned them. In 1995, a group of Kappa Alpha members at the University of Memphis hurled racial slurs while beating a Black student who caused a disturbance outside a frat party, the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported at the time.  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was no exception to the turmoil. Under pressure from student group’s, the school’s Kappa Alpha chapter in 1985 canceled its annual “Sharecropper’s Ball,” which some attended in blackface. Fraternity members said blackface was worn because the event needed both Black and white attendees, but promised to discontinue the practice, according to a news story in the Daily Tar Heel student newspaper.  The Kappa Alpha chapter at North Carolina’s Wake Forest University stopped allowing members to wear Confederate uniform and display the Confederate flag in 1987.  But other chapters held on longer. It wasn’t until Kappa Alpha members at the University of Alabama wore Confederate uniforms during a parade that paused in front of a Black sorority, which elicited intense blowback, that the national headquarters forbade them. It’s unclear if the chapter at UNC banned the uniforms before the national organization did.    Griffin is not the first public official to draw unwanted attention for their college-age embrace of symbols drawn from the darker chapters of the South’s past.  Virginia’s then-governor, Democrat Ralph Northam,came under intense criticism in 2019over a racist photo that appeared on his yearbook page of his medical school. The incident led reporters to scour the college histories of other Southern leaders, forcing a number of politicians to publicly address their time as Kappa Alpha brothers.  Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, then the state’s Republican lieutenant governor,dodged questions in 2019 about photos showing him wearing a Confederate uniformwhile he was a Kappa Alpha member at Millsaps College in the early 1990s. While Reeves was enrolled there in October 1994, other members of the fraternity were disciplined for wearing afro wigs and Confederate battle flags and shouting racial slurs at Black students, the AP reported at the time.  Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMasterdeclined to commentafter yearbooks listed him as the leader of the fraternity’s chapter at the University of South Carolina in 1969, along with photos of members wearing Confederate uniforms and posing with a rebel flag.  And Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, also a Republican,expressed regretfor participating in “Old South” parties as a student at Auburn University in the 1970s.

(Jim Shannon/Hearst Connecticut Media via AP, Pool) This March 13, 2025 image shows the home of Kimberly Sullivan in Waterbury, Conn. (Jim Shannon/Hearst Connecticut Media via AP)     WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) — A Connecticut man who told authorities his stepmotherheld him captivein their home for two decades since he was a boy has asked why his she is not behind bars while awaiting trial, a state prosecutor said Friday. Don Therkildsen Jr., a supervisory assistant state’s attorney, made the remark during a court hearing in Waterbury for Kimberly Sullivan, who pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that included kidnapping and felony assault. Sullivan was ordered to be placed on electronic monitoring, and Therkildsen also asked for house arrest over concerns she could flee. “This victim is afraid. This victim lives in fear,” Therkildsen said in court. “I introduced myself to the victim, explained who I was. His first question in this fear is, ‘Why is she out walking around when I was locked up in a room for 20 years?’” Sullivan, 57, posted $300,000 bail after she was arrested March 12. Shehas denied allegationsthat she kept her stepson locked in a small room in their Waterbury home and limited his food and liquids so much that he weighed only 69 pounds (31 kilograms) when he was rescued. He is 5-feet-9-inches tall (1.75 meters tall). Sullivan’s lawyer, Ioannis Kaloidis, objected to the house arrest request and said Sullivan has complied with all conditions since she posted bail. He also said threats have been made against Sullivan and confining her to house arrest at one location would put her in danger.  The 32-year-old man set a fire in the house on Feb. 17 in an effort to be free, police said. He was rescued by firefighters and taken to a hospital, where staff said he was emaciated from malnutrition. He told policethat he was locked in the small room with no heat or air conditioning for most of every day since he was about 11 years old, allowed out only briefly to do chores. His father, Kregg Sullivan, let him out of the room for longer periods, but he died last year, police said. He said he was hungry all the time. He was unenrolled from Waterbury’s public school system in 2004 after educators contacted state child welfare officials with concerns about his well-being, police said. He apparently was going to be home-schooled. State and local authorities have been looking into how this could have happened, and some are calling for stricter oversight of home-schooling. Waterbury police have said they visited Sullivan’s home twice in 2005 and there were nothing to warrant concern. A former principal at the elementary school the man attended as a child, Tom Pannone, told WVIT-TV that school officials repeatedly called Sullivan and the state Department of Children and Families, or DCF, over concerns that he was too thin and was stealing food and eating things out of the garbage. Police said DCF workers visited the home, but it’s not clear what the agency did. The man told police that Sullivan made him tell authorities everything was OK under the threat of his food being reduced. DCF previously said it could not immediately find any records involving the family. On Friday the agency announced that it found some records in its archives and was reviewing them. Officials did not immediately share details of the records and said they would be providing them to police and state investigators after completing a search and review.

In “The Studio,” though,Seth Rogen’sstudio chief is moreSelina Meyer (“Veep”)than Louis B. Mayer. As much as Rogen’s Matt Remick, head of the fictional Continental Studios, sits in a sought-after seat of power, he’s helpless against larger trends in the film industry. He wants to be making “Chinatown,” but instead his most important task is getting a Kool-Aid movie off the ground. Bryan Cranston’s Continental chief executive asks: Can he do this? “Oh, yeah!” “As pitiful as it is, the conflict that my character lives and breathes every second of his life is one a lot of people with his job are facing in real life,” Rogen says. “They love movies. They’re also responsible to a very specific bottom line and they have to defend the choice they make to a board of people who don’t give a s--- about movies.” “The Studio,” the 10-episode series debuting Wednesday on Apple TV+, may be the definitive portrait of contemporary Hollywood. If movies like “Singin’ in the Rain” and “The Player” captured the movie industry in full swagger, “The Studio” belongs to a more desperate chapter where even the all-powerful feel impotent. Studio heads, too, must tolerate conversations with people who haven’t been to the movies in ages, but who loved “The Bear.” In a recent interview, Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the longtime writing, producing and directing duo behind “Superbad,” “Pineapple Express” and“This Is the End,”said “The Studio” isn’t quite a Hollywood postmortem, no matter how much Cranston’s performance in the helter-skelter CinemaCon-set finale verges toward “Weekend at Bernie’s” territory. “We’re people who have been given great lives from this industry who, in general, though it’s been very frustrating, have gotten to do what they want,” Rogen says. “The show is very specifically written from the perspective of people that think things can work out in Hollywood.” There always is, and probably always will be, reason for optimism in Hollywood. The next big hit is perpetually just around the corner. But as audiences have becomeincreasingly distractedby streaming, TikTok and video games, the film industry — or at least the major studio version of it — has turned into an IP-factory, hoping that franchises, superheroesand horror can sustain itself. There’s still time for a turnaround (there’s that optimism again), but ticket sales in 2025 are down 6.9% from last year and 38.6% from 2019, according to Comscore. The trends are worse if you look at tickets sold rather than dollars earned, since large-format screens beef up ticket prices. More than that, though, “The Studio” — with a boatload of cameos of everyone fromMartin Scorseseto Netflix chiefTed SarandostoZoe Kravitz— taps into a deeper demoralization. Flanked by a team of executives (Kathryn Hahn, Ike Barinholtz, Chase Sui Wonders), Remick finds himself — when not directly obstructing filmmakers he adores, like Scorsese andSarah Polley— beset with questions over whether they’ve cast a racist Kool-Aid movie, if their“Smile”knockoff “Wink” can work or how to sell a movie with zombie diarrhea. Matthew Belloni, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter and founding partner of the media company Puck, appears as himself in the series. He says that there’s truth underlying almost every scene in the “The Studio,” “for better and mostly worse.” “It captures the existential dread that seems to permeate every conversation,” says Belloni. “People recognize that the glory days of Hollywood are over and the whole concept of what Hollywood even means is being redefined. And that has caused everybody in town to go completely crazy. This show captures that craziness very, very well.” “The Studio” isn’t the first time Rogen and Goldberg have had a role in revealing the inner workings of a Hollywood studio. When their2014 North Korean comedy “The Interview”led to thehacking of Sony Pictures,the studio’s private correspondence landed on the internet. “Without ‘The Interview,’ a show like this would have been much harder for us to write,” Rogen says, chuckling. “We got to the CEO-level of problem.” Those problems ultimately included Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascalstepping down. Pascal, who has since been a highly successful producer, has remained a mentor to Rogen and Goldberg. In “The Studio,” she’s fictionalized by Catherine O’Hara as a savvy producer and Remick’s former boss.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  “One of the biggest misconceptions people seem to have with Hollywood is that it’s run by people who only care about money and don’t at all care about film,” Rogen says. “There’s a few of those people,” Goldberg chimes in. “They are out there, for sure,” continues Rogen. “But in general, the people who have ascended to Amy’s level to run studios are people who love movies and can sit in a room with the greatest filmmakers on earth and have an on-the-level conversation about filmmaking.” Rogen and Goldberg, who created the show with Frida Perez and a pair of “Veep” veterans in Peter Huyck and Alex Gregory, began developing “The Studio” during the pandemic. Then, they thought it really might be a satirical elegy for Hollywood. Thetwin blockbusters of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,”though, prompted them to give the series a more hopeful spin. But they were never short on fodder. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, co-creators of the Apple TV+ series “The Studio,” pose on Thursday, March 20, 2025, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  “Most of it is very directly from our lives,” Goldberg says. “As soon as we thought of it, we thought of a hundred episode ideas,” adds Rogen. That includes one episode where Remick joins a date at a hospital fundraiser attended by doctors. That came from Rogen’s own experience attending galas for the Alzheimer’s disease charity he runs with his wife, Lauren Miller. “I find myself at a lot of medical galas and at a lot of tables with doctors who save people’s lives. And they seem to take particular joy in diminishing what I do for a living,” Rogen says laughing. Rebecca Hall and Seth Rogen in a scene from “The Studio.” (Apple TV+ via AP)  Those scenes — the doctors are the ones who love “The Bear” — unfold with Remick claiming that what he does matters, even if that includes a movie that sounds not too dissimilar in vulgarity to his and Goldberg’s R-rated animatedcomedy “Sausage Party.” “What’s funny about Hollywood is how people have imbued every moment with life-altering stakes that could last forever,” says Rogen. “People seem to take their jobs in Hollywood more seriously than the people who are actually making nuclear decisions. That’s what’s terrifying.” As much as it lampoons Hollywood, “The Studio” is also an ode to it. An episode about a missing reel is done in the style of “Chinatown.” Most of the series, which Rogen and Goldberg directed, are shot in long, balletic takes — even the episode in which Remick keeps fouling up an ambitious long take attempted by Polley. Those are just some of the ironies of “The Studio,” which, at the next fundraising gala in Los Angeles, is sure to be, more than any new movie, what most people are talking about.

At least four people died, including some who drowned. Officials warned that the devastation from the storms — which set records in parts of Texas’ low-lying Rio Grande Valley — was only starting to come into focus. In Mexico, hundreds sought temporary shelter, and videos on social media showed military personnel wading through chest-high waters. On the U.S. side, officials said at least three people were killed in Hidalgo County, where officials said more than 21 inches (53 centimeters) of rain this week soaked the city of Harlingen. The region is rich with farmland, and Texas’ agriculture commissioner said the damage included significant losses to agriculture and livestock. “The bed is the only thing dry right now, because the sofas are soaked. Everything is soaked,” said Jionni Ochoa, 46, from his home in Palm Valley, near Harlingen. He and his wife were still waiting to be rescued Friday as the water inside reached their knees. He said water started coming into their house the previous night and began pouring out of the electrical sockets. They turned off the power and tried to save as much as they could. “Things I stacked up, the rain, the water made it float, and it knocked it down. So everything got messed up, everything got ruined,” Ochoa said.  Hidalgo County officials said in a statement that they did not immediately have more information about the three deaths except that they involved law enforcement efforts. The Mexican state of Tamaulipas reported that an 83-year-old man drowned in Reynosa, which is across the border from McAllen, Texas. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the driver of a vehicle suspected of taking part in migrant smuggling tried crossing a flooded roadway in Hidalgo County and plunged into a canal. The agency said the body of one person who drowned was recovered and another was missing. It was not immediately known if those were among the deaths reported by county officials. In Alamo, a small Texas border city, crews responded to more than 100 water rescues, including people stranded in vehicles and trapped in homes, Fire Department Chief R.C. Flores said. Dozens more rescues were made in nearby Weslaco, which was inundated with about 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain, according to Mayor Adrian Gonzalez. “It’s a historic rainstorm, and it’s affecting all the Valley, not just Weslaco,” Gonzalez said. Thousands of power outages were reported, and more than 20 school districts and college campuses canceled classes. Valley International Airport in Harlingen was closed Friday, and all flights were canceled. Between 7 and 12 inches of rain (20 and 31 centimeters) fell in parts of northeastern Mexico, according to Tamaulipas authorities. Luis Gerardo González de la Fuente, state coordinator of emergencies, said the most affected city was Reynosa but conditions were also dangerous in the border cities of Rio Bravo, Miguel Aleman and part of Matamoros, south of Brownsville, Texas. Some 640 military personnel were deployed in the area. Authorities said electricity was being restored as water levels dropped but did not clarify how many people were still without this service. In Texas, Emma Alaniz was resigned to not being able to leave her home in a colonia, which is an unincorporated neighborhood usually located in a rural area of a county with underdeveloped infrastructure. She described her home as being on “an island.” “For today, I won’t be able to go anywhere, because I don’t have a big vehicle,” she said. “I have a small car, and I won’t be able to take it out to the flooded street.” Lozano reported from Houston.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)         People with ties to American universities, most of whom have shown support for pro-Palestinian causes, have been detained in the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. President Donald Trump and other officials have accused protesters and others of being “pro-Hamas,” referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Many protesters have said they were speaking out against Israel’s actions in the war against Hamas in Gaza. Trump’s administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests. More than half a dozen people are known to have been taken into custody or deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in recent weeks. Federal officersdetained 30-year-old Turkish studentRumeysa Ozturk on Tuesday as she walked along a street in suburban Boston. A seniorDepartment of Homeland Securityspokesperson said without providing evidence that an investigation found Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” which is also a U.S.-designated terrorist group. Friends and colleagues of Ozturk said her only known activism was co-authoring an op-ed in a student newspaper that called on Tufts University to engage with student demands to cut ties with Israel. Ozturk has been taken to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. A U.S. District judge in Massachusetts on Friday saidOzturk can’t be deported to Turkeywithout a court order and gave the government until Tuesday evening to respond to an updated complaint filed by Ozturk’s attorneys.  This month, immigration enforcement agentsarrested and detainedMahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, Palestinian activist and graduate student who was prominent inprotestsat Columbia last year. The administration has said it revoked Khalil’s green card because his role in the campus protests amounted to antisemitic support for Hamas. He is fighting deportation. Khalil served as anegotiator for Columbia studentsas they bargained with university officials over ending their campus encampment last spring. He was born in Syria and is married to an American citizen. His lawyersurged a federal judge on Fridayto free their client from a Louisiana immigration detention center and argued his case should not be moved to Louisiana courts. The judge said he would issue a decision soon. Yunseo Chung is a Columbia student and lawful U.S. resident who moved to America from Korea as a child. Chung attended and was arrested at asit-in this month at nearby Barnard Collegeprotesting the expulsion of students who participated in pro-Palestinian activism. The Department of Homeland Security wants to deport Chung and has said she “engaged in concerning conduct,” including being arrested on a misdemeanor charge. A judgeordered immigration agents not to detain Chungwhile her legal challenge is pending. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar from India, was arrested outside his Virginia home anddetained by masked Homeland Security agentson allegations that he spread Hamas propaganda. Suri’s attorney wrote in a court filing that he was targeted because of his social media posts and his wife’s “identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.” Suri holds a visa authorizing him to be in the U.S. as a visiting scholar, and his wife is a U.S. citizen, according to court documents. Suri was taken to a detention facility in Louisiana, according to a government website. His lawyers are seeking his immediate release and to halt deportation proceedings. Leqaa Kordia, a resident of Newark, New Jersey, was detained and accused of failing to leave the U.S. after her student visa expired. Federal authorities said Kordia is a Palestinian from the West Bank and that she was arrested at or near Columbia during pro-Palestinian protests. Columbia has said it has no record of her being a student there. Kordia is being held in an immigration detention center in Alvarado, Texas, according to a government database. Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and doctoral student at Columbia, fled the U.S. after immigration agents searched for her at her university residence. The Trump administration has said it revoked Srinivasan’s visa for “advocating for violence and terrorism.” Srinivasan opted to“self-deport.” Officials didn’t say what evidence they have that Srinivasan advocated violence. Her lawyers deny the accusations, and shetold The New York Timesthat she didn’t help to organize protests at Columbia. University of Alabama doctoral student Alireza Doroudiof Iran was detained by ICE on Tuesday. David Rozas, a lawyer representing Doroudi, says Douridi was studying mechanical engineering. His student visa was revoked in 2023, but his lawyer has said he was eligible to continue his studies as long as he maintained his student status and met other requirements of his entry into the United States. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Friday that the arrest was made over the revocation of Doroudi’s student visa, saying he “posed significant national security concerns.” A spokesperson said they could not share additional details. Unlike some other students targeted by ICE, Dorudi’s lawyer said there is no indication that his client was involved in any political protests. Doroudi told his lawyer he isn’t aware of any suspected criminal activity or violations. He was detained in Alabama but will be moved to an immigration facility in Jena, Louisiana. Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist from Lebanon who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island, was deported this month, even though a federal judge ordered that she not be removed until a hearing could be held. Homeland Security officials saidAlawieh was deportedas soon as she returned to the U.S. from Lebanon, despite having a U.S. visa, because she “openly admitted” supporting formerHezbollah leaderHassan Nasrallah. Alawieh told officers she followed him for his religious and spiritual teachings and not his politics, court documents said. She was to start work at Brown University as an assistant professor of medicine. Stephanie Marzouk, Alawieh’s lawyer, has said she will fight to get the 34-year-old doctor back to the U.S. Momodou Taal is a doctoral student at Cornell University whose visa was revoked after he participated in campus demonstrations. Taal, a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia, has asked a federal judge to halt his detention during his court challenge. The government says it revoked Taal’s student visa because of his alleged involvement in “disruptive protests.” His attorneys say the 31-year-old doctoral student in Africana studies was exercising free speech rights. Taal said he will surrender to immigration authorities if the court determines the government is acting legally. Taal said in a court declaration that “I feel like a prisoner already, although all I have done is exercise my rights.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Kirill Zykov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)                              MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that President Donald Trump’s push for control overGreenlandwasn’t surprising given longtime U.S. interest in the mineral-rich territory. Speaking at a policy forum in the Artic port of Murmansk, Putin noted that the United States first considered plans to win control over Greenland in the 19th century, and then offered to buy it from Denmark after World War II. “It can look surprising only at first glance and it would be wrong to believe that this is some sort of extravagant talk by the current U.S. administration,” Putin said. “It’s obvious that the United States will continue to systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic.” Trump irkedmuch of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Fridayon a trip that was scaled backafter an uproar by Greenlanders and Danes. Speaking on Thursday, Putin noted that Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening itsmilitary capabilityin the polar region.  “We are certainly concerned about NATO members describing the Far North as the region of possible conflicts,” he said, noting that Russia’s neighbors Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance. “Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernizing military infrastructure.” Russia has sought to assert its influence over wide areas of the Arctic in competition with the United States, Canada, Denmark and Norway as shrinking polar ice from the warming planet offers new opportunities for resources and shipping routes. China also has shown an increasing interest in the region, believed to hold up to one-fourth of the Earth’s undiscovered oil and gas. “We won’t allow any infringement on our country’s sovereignty, reliably safeguard our national interests while supporting peace and stability in the polar region,” Putin said. While pledging to strengthen Russia’s military foothold in the Arctic, Putin said that Moscow was holding the door open to broader international cooperation in the region. “The stronger our positions will be, the more significant the results will be and the broader opportunities we will have to launch international projects in the Arctic involving the countries that are friendly to us, and, possibly, Western countries if they show interest in joint work. I’m sure the time will come to launch such projects.” Kirill Dmitriev,head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Putin’s envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S. officials, told reporters last month that Russia and the U.S. should develop joint energy ventures. “We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions,” he said.

Their paper,published Thursday in the journal Science,finds that global warming has notably reduced the amount of water that’s being stored around the world in soil, lakes, rivers, snow and other places, with potentially irreversible impacts on agriculture and sea level rise. The researchers say the significant shift of water from land to the ocean is particularly worrisome for farming, and hope their work will strengthen efforts to reduce water overuse.

(AP Photo/Edmar Barros, File)  Earth’s soil moisture dropped by over 2,000 gigatons in roughly the last 20 years, the study says. For context, that’s more than twice Greenland’s ice loss from 2002 to 2006, the researchers noted. Meanwhile, the frequency of once-in-a-decade agricultural and ecological droughts has increased, global sea levels have risen and the Earth’s pole has shifted. Ryu and his colleagues used three different data sources to verify that Earth storing less water on land than it once did. He also said their results reveal a deeper truth about the land, one farmers have to contend with frequently: When a big, dramatic rainfall event comes after a drought, sometimes leading to huge floods, that doesn’t mean the water stored underground has recovered.  “It seems that lands lost their elasticity to recover the previous level,” he said.

(AP Photo/Ivan Valencia, File)  Whether that elasticity ever returns will depend on whether humans take action on climate change and significantly change water use, the researchers say. The increasing heat stress on plants means they need more water. Agriculture, particularly irrigated agriculture, continues to draw up more water than it can afford. And humans are continuing to emit greenhouse gases without a strong effort to reverse course. “There are long-term climate changes that have happened in the past and presumably could occur in the future that could reverse the trend described, but probably not in our lifetimes,” said Katharine Jacobs, a University of Arizona professor of environmental science who wasn’t involved in the study. “Because greenhouse gases will continue to cause global warming well into the future, the rate of evaporation and transpiration is not likely to reduce any time soon.” The study also confirms an explanation for a slight wobble in the rotation of the Earth — it’s being driven by the changing moisture levels of the planet. “When I read this thing, I was very excited,” said Luis Samaniego, a professor of hydrology and data science at the University of Potsdam who wrotean overview commentary discussing the findings in Science.“It’s a fascinating puzzle of all disciplines that came at the right moment to verify something that was not possible before.” A fisher rows his Shikara, or traditional wooden boat, on his way home during sunset at the Dal Lake, in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Feb. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File)  But Samaniego stressed that the finding isn’t only fascinating; it’s a wake-up call. Imagine the planet’s wobble like an electrocardiogram for the Earth, he said. Seeing this result is like detecting an arrhythmia. Choosing not to listen to the doctor — “that’s what we are playing around with at the moment,” he said.

Do you eat a meal in 20 minutes or less? It might be time to slow down,https://apnews.com/article/eating-fast-tips-to-slow-down-4ba7e9760ac5903fe29dc38a4205d701,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Salmon poached in green salsa and topped with baked chips are displayed for a photo in Concord, N.H. (AP Photo/Matthew Mead, File) LONDON (AP) — You can have your cake and eat it too —just do it slowly. Experts tend to focus on the kinds of foods you can eat to improve your health. But the speed at which you devour your dinner matters just as much. There are risks with eating too fast — think stuck food and the potential to overeat before your brain tells you to stop. (Inhaling your food also risks annoying your slower-paced dining companions or the person who took the time to cook your meal.) Here are some tips from scientists on how to slow down and take a more mindful approach to consuming yourdiet. If you’re the kind of person who can regularly polish off breakfast, lunch or dinner in less than 20-30 minutes, you are eating too fast. “It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to communicate to the brain via a whole host of hormonal signals that it’s full,” said Leslie Heinberg, at the Center for Behavioral Health at the Cleveland Clinic. “So when people eat rapidly, they can miss these signals and it’s very easy to eat beyond the point of fullness.” People who eat quickly are likely to swallow more air, Heinberg said, which could lead to bloating or indigestion. Not chewing your food properly can also compromise digestion, meaning you won’t get all of the nutrients from your food. Unchewed pieces of food also could get stuck in your esophagus. Some previous studies have suggested that people who eat quickly have the highest risk ofobesity, while the slowest eaters were the least likely to be obese.  For starters, turn off the TV and put down your phone. “If you’re eating while you watch TV, people tend to eat until there’s a commercial or the show is over,” Heinberg said, adding that people are less inclined to pay attention to the body’s own signals that it’s full. “When we do things while we’re eating, we’re eating less mindfully. And that often causes us to eat more.” She said that when people focus exclusively on eating, they tend to enjoy the meal more and eat less. Heinberg also acknowledged the pace at which you eat is often an ingrained habit, but said change is still possible. She suggested things like using your non-dominant hand to eat, trying utensils you might not ordinarily use like chopsticks or taking a deliberate break to drink water when your plate is partially empty. If you have a busy life, it might be unavoidable to eat lunch at a work meeting or snack while running errands. But Sarah Berry, chief scientist at the British nutritional company ZOE, said when possible, “be mindful of what the food tastes and feels like.” “If we’re not fully present, it’s very easy to eat more quickly and not notice how much we’ve consumed,” Berry said. One of the simplest things to do is to increase the number of bites you take, said Helen McCarthy, a clinical psychologist with the British Psychological Society. “If you chew each mouthful a little bit longer, that will slow down your eating,” she said. The kind of food you eat may also make a difference, pointing out that it’s much easier to eatultraprocessedor fast foods quicker, because they typically have a softer texture. “It’s hard to eat vegetables and protein at the same rate as something that’s highly processed and requires less chewing,” McCarthy said. Some of her patients also reported an unintentional side effect once they began eating more slowly, referencing one woman who often ate a tube of potato chips every evening. When McCarthy told her to slow down and eat every single chip individually, her patient told her “it was like having a mouthful of claggy chemicals.” “She didn’t find (the chips) enjoyable anymore,” McCarthy said.

(AP video shot by Hau Dinh/ production by Annika Wolters)                HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The taste of banh te — a steamed rice cake with an enticing filling of mushrooms and minced pork — captures the quintessence of northern Vietnamese cuisine: Humble ingredients, prepared perfectly and often enjoyed with a funkyfish saucedip.  This balance of flavors is what Quang Dung, the chef and owner of Chapter Dining in Hanoi, sought in his modern take on the dish. His version of banh te is unapologetically fancy. The steamed rice cake is enriched with pork stock and served with a raw scallop and pickled daikon shavings. Freshness comes from coriander used several ways, sweetness from fried shallot oil, and a delicate floral essence extracted from a giant water bug used in northern Vietnamese cooking.  And then, a splash of fish sauce — or nuoc mam — brings it all together in a savory broth that suffuses the dish.  “Fish sauce is one of the foundations for flavor,” he said. Dishes made with fish sauce are prepared at Chapter Dining, a fine dining restaurant, on March 1, 2025, in Hanoi, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   It’s also the basis for Vietnam’s diverse and vibrant cuisine. Just a drop of the amber liquid can transform a dish by boosting umami and savory notes. Made by fermenting fish — often anchovies that are getting harder to catch because of climate change — in salt for many months, the taste of each bottle varies depending on factors like the ratio of salt to fish or the length of fermentation.  Fish sauce is a staple across Vietnam, used in a variety of dishes. As a dipping sauce for spring rolls or savory crepes called banh xeo. In marinades for grilled meat dishes like Hanoi’s pork and noodle classic called bun cha. In salad dressings and in braised meat dishes like the southern classic where pork is cooked in bittersweet caramel and fish sauce. Much of Vietnam’s cuisine is shaped by the decades of hardship during and after the Vietnam War, but today its economy and its cities are booming. And fish sauce is finding its way into unusual applications.  A speciality cocktail made with fish sauce is displayed at the Liquid Store, on Feb. 19, 2025, in Hanoi, Vietnam. (AP Photo/Yannick Peterhans)   In Hanoi, fish sauce is used in some cocktails to add umami, and Dung has used it to add a Vietnamese twist to French hollandaise sauce and even flavor ice cream.  “It is very versatile,” he said. “A lot of fun to use and to explore.”  Dung’s culinary explorations began early. His mother taught him to cook at 10 so he could feed himself while his banker parents worked long hours. He learned how to make rice, fry eggs, and boil vegetables. Soon after, he was braising pork and making spicy fried rice. Growing up, he assumed everyone could cook — after all, his friends in Hanoi could. But it wasn’t until he moved to the United Kingdom as a teenager to finish high school that he realized this wasn’t the case.  He eventually studied finance in coastal Devon, but while working part-time in restaurants, he fell in love with all things food: learning from his peers, consuming cookbooks by top chefs, and spending all his savings to eat out at restaurants. “When you’re 18, you’re a sponge. You absorb everything,” he said. Fish sauce is an indelible part of Vietnam’s culture and essential for its vibrant cuisine. In small fishing villages across Vietnam’s long coast, families have made it for centuries but climate change and overfishing threaten the anchovies crucial for fish sauce production. (AP video shot by Hau Dinh/ production by Annika Wolters)  He came back to Vietnam in 2013 and got a job working in a bank. But every evening, he worked a second job — as a junior chef for a five-star hotel in Hanoi at night. He eventually quit both jobs in 2015 and started a gastropub in Hanoi. That didn’t go according to plan as he “managed to do everything wrong.” More failures followed — he calls them “lessons in my dictionary” — but in 2021 he opened Chapter Dining, a fine dining restaurant in the heart of Hanoi’s Old Quarter that celebrates local, seasonal produce and the cooking traditions of Vietnam’s mountainous north.  The restaurant, with its facade of steel slats, leads to an open kitchen where Dung and his team regularly create a 14-course tasting menu that won it a spot in the coveted Michelin Guide Hanoi in 2023 and 2024.  “I can finally call it ... my restaurant, my food, my philosophy,” he said.  Central to that philosophy is sustainability. Each menu is seasonal — warm, comforting dishes for the cold months and fresh, lighter dishes in the summer — and the ingredients are locally sourced. Given the erratic weather in the climate-vulnerable country, this means that he can’t always be sure of what produce will be available. So the menu adapts, letting nature decide, and the bottle of fish sauce is never too far away.  “Fish sauce isn’t just about saltiness. It is as much about umaminess. It is magic,” he said, adding that he hoped more people would cook with fish sauce.  A good starting point, he suggested, is to use it to add a bit of that magic to the humble omelet. Three eggs, two teaspoons of fish sauce, a heap of finely diced spring onions all beaten together. Add pork fat to a hot pan and roll the eggs around.  “And then you’ve got a very nice fish sauce omelet. That goes down really well with rice,” he said.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Coaches still playing in the NCAA Tournament are having to split their time between preparing their teams for the Sweet 16 and talking to potential transfers who have entered the portal. Such is life incollege basketball. Dawn Staley is one of those coaches, and she said it’s a huge challenge. “I think the timing is all screwed up. It really plays on your ability to compartmentalize,” the South Carolina coach said Thursday. “If you aren’t — I mean, most coaches are, but if you are not really good at it, it can sidetrack you. But for us, the main thing, the main thing at this point is trying to win another national championship.” The portal opened Tuesday and 595 women’s basketball players entered in the first 24 hours, according to the NCAA. That’s 2 1/2 times more than the 233 players that entered in the same time frame last year. There were 757men’s basketball playersin the portal in the opening 24 hours this year which also was more than double last season. This is the first year that the portal opened up this week. Last year, it opened a day after the NCAA Tournament selection show. As of Friday morning there were over 1,000 women’s basketball players in the portal. One name not in the portal yet, but entering soon is Florida State guard Ta’Niya Latson, who led all Division I players in scoring this season. Her representatives at Klutch Sports Group confirmed to The Associated Press that she was exploring her options to transfer. Latson’s decision was first reported by ESPN.  The portal has exploded over the last few years with NIL money becoming a major reason for players to transfer. “A lot of kids are leaving because of it, but at the same time, I feel like you have to follow your heart instead of the money,” said guard Te-Hina Paopao, who landed at South Carolina as a transfer last year from Oregon. “Just be able to have fun with the game and create those relationships that I’ve created, and just be able to fall in love with the game again, and continue to play the game that you love.” Paopao isn’t alone in her sentiments. Sedona Prince, who transfered twice in her career starting at Texas before going to Oregon and now TCU, feels that players shouldn’t just be after getting the most NIL money. “I would say in this new era, I mean, right before (revenue) share and stuff, don’t go for the money,” Prince said. “It’s just going to fail. I know a lot of kids are trying to get paid, as they should. That’s how it should be. That’s how it always should have been. But be very smart.” Maryland forward Saylor Poffenbarger started her career at UConn before transferring to Arkansas and then the Terrapins. She knows all too well about how the transfer portal works. “When I went into the portal the second time, I had to pick the things that were important to me,” she said. “It’s kind of it’s crazy. It’s hectic. Everyone throwing numbers, everyone’s throwing this, everyone throwing that. You kind of just have to stay true to you and ... pick a school that aligns with your morals because at the end of the day, you’re you and the school’s not changing for you when you enter them.” While students enter the portal when their season is over, the current timing makes it difficult for the roughly 10% of programs still playing. One problem is currently there’s no better time for the portal to open. The Student Athletic Advisory Committee agreed to lessen the length that the portal was open from 45 days to 30, which allowed to change the timing to this year’s date. Some coaches wanted a close date no later than May 1 because of final exams and summer school enrollment so that players could be eligible at their new school. With the 30-day window and May 1 deadline, the portal had to open before the Final Four ended. So Staley and the other coaches in the Sweet 16 are having to multi-task even more than usual. If players don’t understand that Staley may not have all the time to recruit them right now because the Gamecocks are trying to win a championship, then they might not be the right fit for the program. Staley said she was going to call a few players after finishing with her media obligations on Thursday. “You still have to do it. Yes, I’m going to call somebody when I leave here. A few people. Just because you got to let them know, ‘Hey, we’re thinking about you,’” she said. “We got this run we’re trying to (finish) but you are a priority for us.” UCLA coach Cori Close has noticed another problem with the timing of the portal opening: Schools now are quicker to fire and hire coaches before the portal opens so they don’t get behind. “I think we have been rushing hires so that we could get people in place before the portal, which has distractions from their current teams,” she said. “I am going to be advocating in the offseason that we make another shift. “I don’t think it’s in the best interests of our game and the best interests of our kids and the best interests of our coaches to have that being a distraction in the most magnified time.” AP Sports Writer Anne M.

(James Carbone /Newsday via AP)               RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) — The question of whether certain DNA evidence can be used in the upcoming trial of a Manhattan architect charged in astring of deathsknown as theGilgo Beach killingsis the focus of court hearings that began Friday on Long Island. Lawyers for Rex Heuermann want DNA tests conducted by Astrea Forensics on hairs recovered from most of the seven victims in the case to be excluded from the trial, saying the California-based lab’s method has never been accepted in a New York court of law. But an academic expert testifying in the pre-trial hearing in Riverhead court said the type of testing used, known as nuclear DNA, or “whole genome sequencing,” is widely accepted in the scientific community. Dr. Kelley Harris, a University of Washington professor of genome sciences, described Astrea Forensics’ method as an “elegant and powerful” way to determine whether hair fragments pulled from a crime scene match those taken from suspects. Heuermann’s attorney, Michael Brown, sought to temper Harris’ testimony, noting during his cross-examination that she had no background in the forensic science used in criminal cases. He also pressed Harris on her close ties to the co-founder of Astrea Forensics, Dr. Richard Green, who she has coauthored research papers with and considers a colleague. “She’s the witness for hire, and she was suggested by Dr. Green to be a proponent of this magic, as we call it,” Brown said after the daylong hearing.  He also took aim at Astrea Forensics’ use of the publicly accessible1,000 Genomes Project, which sequenced the DNA of some 2,500 people worldwide, as the reference pool for comparing hair samples in the case. “Hopefully the point got across that it has no business being utilized in a criminal court,” Brown said outside court. “The 1,000 Genomes Project has been around for quite a while and it’s never been used in a forensic setting, and the reason they don’t use it as a population reference is because it’s simply not enough people to compare it to.” The proceedings continue next Wednesday when other experts are expected to testify before Judge Timothy Mazzei renders a decision. Heuermann, who was dressed in a dark suit, didn’t speak during Friday’s hearing. Asa Ellerup, whoreached a divorce settlementwith Heuermann on Thursday, was also in court, along with the couple’s daughter and the family’s lawyer. No trial date has been set for the case, which spans decades of killings on Long Island. Heuermann’s legal team also wants to break the case into multiple trials over concerns about the “cumulative effect” of the evidence presented by prosecutors. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney’s office has opposed that request. Mazzei is expected to rule on it soon. Prosecutors argued in legal briefs ahead of the hearing that whole genome sequencing has been accepted in peer-reviewed scientific journals and by federal regulators, paleontologists, virologists and medical communities. They say the findings by Astrea Forensics were also independently corroborated by another lab’s mitochondrial DNA testing -- a methodology long accepted by New York courts. Since late 2010, police on Long Islandhave been investigating the deathsof at least 10 people — mostly female sex workers — whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach. Heuermann, who lives in nearby Massapequa Park, was arrested in 2023 and charged in thedeaths of three of the victimsbetween 2009 and 2010: Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Megan Waterman. While in custody, he was subsequently charged in the deaths of four other women:Valerie Mackin 2000,Jessica Taylorin 2003,Maureen Brainard-Barnesin 2007 and Sandra Costilla in 1993. Heuermann has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty to all counts. Follow Philip Marcelo attwitter.com/philmarcelo.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah, File) President Donald Trump is seated inside his limousine after arriving on Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport, Friday, March 28, 2025, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)     WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpcommuted the sentence of Ozy Media co-founder Carlos Watson, a White House official said Friday, just hours before Watson was due to report to prison for a nearly10-year sentencein a financial conspiracy case. Watson wasconvicted last yearin a closely watched case that showcased the implosion of an ambitious startup company at a time of turmoil in the media industry. He had been ordered to surrender to prison on Friday. The commutation was confirmed by a senior White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the decision and spoke on condition of anonymity. A lawyer who represented Watson declined to comment. Trump has aggressively used his presidential power to commute sentences and issue pardons for people who he believes were treated unfairly by the justice system. The president himself was convicted last year in a case involving hush money payments, part of what he has described as a politically motivated witch hunt against him. Watson’s commutation was among astring of other acts of clemencyrevealed by the White House on Friday. They included Trevor Milton, the founder of electric vehicle company Nikola, who had been sentenced to four years for fraudulently exaggerating the potential of his technology and was pardoned; and three entrepreneurs who founded and helped run the cryptocurrency exchange BITMEX, which was ordered to pay a $100 million fine earlier this year after prosecutors said it “willfully flouted U.S. anti-money laundering laws to boost revenue.” They had been sentenced to probation and were also pardoned. Ozy was founded in 2012 on a premise of providing a fresh, sophisticated-but-not-stuffy take on politics, culture and more — billed as “the new and the next” — while amplifying minority and marginalized voices.  It announced it was shutting down in fall 2021 less than a week after a New York Timescolumnraised questions about the media organization’s claims of millions of viewers and readers while also pointing out a potential case of securities fraud. Watson was arrested in February 2023 after two of the company’s top executives pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Prosecutors said Watson deceived investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers and suggesting deals were final when they were not. At one point, Watson’s co-founder pretended to be a YouTube executive on a phone call with potential investors, according to prosecutors. After Watson’s sentencing, then-Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said the jury had determined that “Watson was a con man who told lie upon lie upon lie to deceive investors into buying stock in his company.” Ozy Media “collapsed under the weight of Watson’s dishonest schemes,” Peace said. But Watson, who is Black, called the case “a modern lynching” and argued that he was the victim of “selective prosecution.” “I made mistakes. I’m very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,” Watson said, but “I don’t think it’s fair.” U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said during sentencing that the “quantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.” Watson held degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, worked on Wall Street, had on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and boasted entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded in his 20s. Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts and amusic-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning “Black Women OWN the Conversation,” which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled — and dissembled — to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders’ testimony. The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, file)     David Childs, the lead architect of the One World Trade Center skyscraper that rose from the site where the Twin Towers collapsed in New York City during the 9/11 attacks, has died. He was 83. Childs died on Wednesday in Pelham, New York, from Lewy body dementia, which had been diagnosed in September, his son, Nicholas Childs said. While he was perhaps best known for his work on One World Trade Center,considered to bethe tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, Childs also was instrumental in other important projects, including a new master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C., an expansion of Dulles International Airport in Virginia and the 7 World Trade Center building in Manhattan, according to his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. “David’s contribution to the firm was extensive and profound, and we will always be grateful to David for his leadership, his impact, and his friendship,” Skidmore, Owings & Merrill said in a statement. “We will miss him dearly and extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to his family.” A fond memory that Nicholas Childs has was when his father drew a rendering of what the One World Trade Center property would look like while they were out having lunch in New York, some years after 9/11 but well before the plans were finalized. “He picked up a paper napkin, took out a pen, and drew what became the ultimate design of the building on the napkin for me,” Nicholas Childs said in a phone interview Friday, adding that he still has the drawing.  He said his father was a civic-minded architect who would often use a quote by 20th century American-German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe — “God is in the details.” “He cared deeply about those details and making something beautiful,” Nicholas Childs said. “But he also wanted to make sure, I think as any great architect, that it was a balance of form and function, that it worked for people.” The 1,776-foot-tall (540-meter-tall) One World Trade Center, once known as the Freedom Tower, is the centerpiece of the redevelopment of ground zero, along with the memorial pools placed where the Twin Towers stood. Opened in 2014, it sports a steel and glass structure that rises into the sky with a tapered, eight-triangle body, topped by a 408-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) needle. The final design was produced after contentious negotiations between Childs and Daniel Libeskind, who designed the overall plan for the site, and arguments between government officials over what should be built at ground zero and objections by some relatives of 9/11 victims to the design of the Trade Center memorial. Libeskind had drawn the first plans for building, a twisting glass skyscraper with an off-center spire meant to invoke the Statue of Liberty. Childs produced a sleeker version of Libeskind’s design, then reworked it after police expressed concerns that the building was not sturdy enough to withstand a truck bomb. In announcing the new design plans, Childs said the One World Trade Center tower is “iconic, simple and pure in its form, a memorable form that will reclaim the resilience and the spirit of our democracy.” He also called it “the safest building in the world,” with features including wider staircases, a separate stairway and elevator for firefighters, “blast-resistant glazing” and more public stairways with direct access to the street. Childs was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1941 and grew up in his early childhood years in Washington, D.C., before moving to Mount Kisco, New York. He attended the private Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, before going to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in architecture. He was hired by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1971 for its Washington, D.C., office, where he worked on projects including a new master plan for the National Mall, the Constitution Gardens park along the mall and the Four Seasons Hotel. He transferred to the firm’s New York City office in 1984 and had a hand in significant projects in the city, including 1 Worldwide Plaza in the Hell’s Kitchen section of Manhattan and the Deutsche Bank Center, formerly called the Time Warner Center, with its twin skyscraper towers at Columbus Circle. Childs also worked on the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, Canada, the Canary Wharf development in London and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In 2004, he was honored with a Rome Prize for architecture, awarded by the American Academy in Rome for innovative work in the arts and humanities. Childs is survived by his wife, Annie; three children, Nicholas, Joshua and Jocelyn; and several grandchildren. The family is planning a small, private memorial in the coming weeks, followed by a larger service around May, Nicholas Childs said.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)                   LONDON (AP) —King Charles IIIwas briefly hospitalized for observation on Thursday after experiencing “temporary side effects’’ related to a scheduledcancer treatment, Buckingham Palace said in a statement.  His engagements for Thursday afternoon and Friday were canceled.  “His majesty has now returned to Clarence House and as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow’s diary program will also be rescheduled,’’ the palace said. “His majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result.’’  The king’s health has been closely watched ever since early last year when he announced that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Charles, 76, stepped away from public duties for about three months butcontinued fulfilling state duties, such as reviewing government papers and meeting with the prime minister.  Charles’cancer diagnosishas heaped pressure on the British monarchy, which is still evolving after the 70-year reign of the late Queen Elizabeth II.

(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali, File)   When he succeeded his mother in September 2022, Charles’ task was to demonstrate that the 1,000-year-old institution remains relevant in a modern nation whose citizens come from all corners of the globe. But this task takes much time and energy.  Although the duties of a constitutional monarch are largely ceremonial, the royal whirl can be exhausting. Besides the occasional procession in full royal regalia, there are meetings with political leaders, dedication ceremonies and events honoring the accomplishments of British citizens. That added up to 161 days of royal engagements during Charles’s first year on the throne.   Charles’ illness came as his daughter-in-law, Kate, the Princess of Wales,was also diagnosed with cancer. Kate, the wife of Prince William, took more than six months off before returning to public duties in late September.

Residue from human waste has long wound up as farm fertilizer.

Opposition to the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer is growing across the country. While the practice has been happening for decades, there are increasing concerns about potential pollution of groundwater from toxic chemicals in wastewater. (AP Video: Joshua A. Bickel) WELLSTON, Okla. (AP) — When Leslie Stewart moved to her home in a rural expanse of Lincoln County outside of Oklahoma City more than 20 years ago, she thought she’d found a slice of heaven. In a town of fewer than 700 people, her son could attend a good school and her acreage offered plenty of room to raise goats and let her dogs run.  But several years ago, her neighbor began applying sewage sludge, which consists largely of human waste left over from municipal wastewater treatment facilities, as a fertilizer on his farmland, causing a rancid smell so powerful it nearly took her breath away.  “The smell is so overwhelming that it goes through my oxygen machine and straight up my nose, which makes it very difficult for me to even walk out my door,” said Stewart, 53, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Leslie Stewart uses her inhaler, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, at her home in Wellston, Okla. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)    Leslie Stewart, left, sits inside her living room with her husband, Danny, right, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, in Wellston, Okla. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   In the summer, the sewage sludge, referred to in the industry as biosolids, attracted so many flies there was no way to keep them out of the house.  “They come through the vents. They come through the vent on the stove,” she said. “It’s just absolutely miserable.”  Stories like Stewart’s are common in rural areas across the U.S. And while the application of sewage sludge as a fertilizer on farmland has been happening for decades, opposition is mounting amid growing environmental concerns about potential pollution of groundwater from toxic chemicals in wastewater. One county in Texasdeclared a state of disasterthis year amid reported deaths of fish and cattle, as well as the contamination of groundwater, in areas where sewage sludge was being used as fertilizer. A crew applies sewage sludge to a field, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, in Wellston, Okla. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   Now the battle over how to place guardrails on the practice is playing out in legislatures even in red states like Oklahoma. Maine has temporarily banned the land application of sewage sludge and Oklahoma is considering a similar ban. Many other states are more closely regulating the practice.   One big concern is the human health risk from toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as forever chemicals because they don’t degrade in the environment. They’re linked to health issues such as low birth weight and liver disease along with certain types of cancers. These chemicals, which are found in some nonstick cookware, grease-resistant food packaging, carpet fibers and certain cosmetics, can end up in wastewater and ultimately in the sludge that is used to fertilize farmland.  Farmers typically get the sludge for free, saving them hundreds of dollars per acre over synthetic fertilizer, said Brian Arnall, a professor of plant and soil sciences at Oklahoma State University.  Astudy released this yearby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests human health risks exceeding EPA’s thresholds, sometimes by “several orders of magnitude,” for scenarios where farmers applied the sludge to their land. Another study published last year by theAmerican Chemical Societyfound that PFAs can leak from biosolids into groundwater after a single application.  In Oklahoma, the issue has become so contentious at the state Capitol that a longtime state House member was upset in a GOP primary last year after he acknowledged using sewage sludge during a town hall-style forum and defended the practice as a private property rights issue.   Oklahoma Republican Rep. Jim Shaw, who opposes using sewage sludge as fertilizer, poses for a portrait, Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025, in Oklahoma City. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   Rep. Jim Shaw, the winner of that race, called the issue a major reason for his victory. He’s now seeking to ban the practice statewide.  “I think we’re rapidly approaching an emergency issue in our state and across the nation,” Shaw said. “It is absolutely at the top of my list as needing traction on it immediately.”  The issue is particularly acute in Shaw’s part of the state, where nearby Oklahoma City has an estimated 5,000 acres that have been permitted for land application of its sewage sludge.  Among those who want to keep using sewage sludge as fertilizer are cities and towns across the state who have found it cheaper than other ways of getting rid of the material, like burning it or putting it in landfills. Oklahoma City wastewater officials declined to be interviewed but provided a fact sheet on their use of biosolids that estimated developing an alternative to land application would cost more than $100 million in capital improvements and take as long as 10 years to implement.   Sewage Sludge, also known as biosolids, produced as part of the wastewater treatment process, sit on a concrete area, at bottom, Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025, at the North Canadian Wastewater Treatment Plant in Jones, Okla. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   The state’s Department of Environmental Quality has rules that require any biosolids used as fertilizer to meet certain criteria on levels of heavy metals and pathogen reduction requirements, but the agency acknowledged they aren’t currently testing for PFAS.  Several Oklahoma farmers who apply sewage sludge to their property, including Stewart’s neighbor, declined to speak to The Associated Press.  Synagro, the nation’s largest processors of biosolids, said in a statement that all the sewage sludge used by the company and its customers meets federal and state requirements.  “Biosolids provide multiple benefits to overall soil quality and health, including improved moisture absorption ability, recycling of micro and macro nutrients, carbon sequestering, reduced nutrient leaching, and lower use of industrially produced chemical fertilizers,” the company said. “Another key benefit is keeping biosolids out of landfills where they can cause methane emissions that contribute to climate change.” Saundra Traywick pets some of her donkeys, Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2025, at her farm in Luther, Okla. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)   None of that satisfies Saundra Traywick, who raises donkeys with her family in the town of Luther outside of Oklahoma City and has become a fierce opponent of sewage sludge as fertilizer.  After getting Luther to ban the practice several years ago, she has taken her crusade to the state Capitol and found herself fighting against cities that want to maintain the status quo.  “They can not have to pay for a landfill or to upgrade their wastewater treatment plants, and instead spend money on art, parks and beautification projects and arenas, and continue to dump this on people outside their districts,” she said. “The injustice of that just blows my mind.” A crew applies biosolids to a field, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, in Wellston, Okla.

Indicted Hawaii doctor’s wife details alleged hiking trail attack in restraining order petition,https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-doctor-arrested-hiking-trail-wife-75bf8d90c81b5de3c7d277a0535c2674,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HONOLULU (AP) — Ananesthesiologist hiking with his wifeon a precarious trail in Hawaii grabbed her by the arms and started pushing her toward the edge of a cliff before attempting to inject her with a syringe, the woman wrote in a petition for a temporary restraining order against her husband, who was indicted Friday on attempted murder charges. Gerhardt Konig and his wife were visiting Oahu from their home on Maui on Monday when he allegedly tried tokill her on the hiking trail,prosecutors said. An attorney who represented Konig during a hearing Thursday hasn’t responded to an email seeking comment. The petition for a restraining order said that in December, Konig accused his wife of having an affair, “which led to extreme jealously on his part.” They have been in therapy and counseling since, she said. A judge signed an order Friday that says Konig must stay away from his wife and their children. The Associated Press isn’t naming the wife because she says she is a victim of domestic violence. EDITOR’S NOTE: This story includes discussion of domestic violence. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the national domestic violence hotline:1-800-799-7233in the U.S.  On Sunday, the couple traveled to Oahu to celebrate her birthday, she said in the petition, while their sons, ages 2 and 4, stayed home on Maui with a nanny and family. On Monday, Konig suggested they go on a hike in Honolulu that she described in the petition as having “narrow ridge sections with steep drop-offs on both sides.” “During the hike, I became uneasy and informed Gerhardt that I did not want to continue,” she said. “Gerhardt hiked a little further and then came back to get me.” She then climbed a tree so that her husband could take a photo of her, while he held her phone and hiking bag. He then suggested taking a photo near the edge of a cliff. “I asked him to move so that I could move away from the cliff, because I was feeling dizzy,” she said. He moved. Later, he grabbed her by her upper arms and started pushing her toward the cliff’s edge while yelling that he was sick of her, the petition said. “At first I thought he was joking, but I quickly realized he was seriously trying to make me fall off the cliff,” she said. They began wrestling and she screamed and pleaded for him to stop, fearing for her life, the petition said. During the struggle, she said he grabbed his bag and took out a syringe and tried to inject her. “I do not know what was in the syringe, but Gerhardt is an anesthesiologist and has access to several potentially lethal medications as part of his employment,” she said. She said she bit his arm in an attempt to defend herself. He then appeared to calm down, but then grabbed a nearby rock and “began bashing me repeatedly on the head with it,” she said. Two women on the trail saw what was happening and said they were calling 911. The women helped her down the trail while Konig went in another direction. An ambulance took her to a hospital and her husband was arrested that evening. She said in the petition that she later learned that Konig contacted his adult son, her stepson, and said he had tried to kill her but she got away and that he wanted to kill himself by jumping off a cliff. Konig is an anesthesiologist at Maui Health, which operates hospitals and clinics in Maui County and is an affiliate of Kaiser Permanente. Maui Health said in a statement to media organizations that he was suspended pending investigation. Kaiser Permanente said in a statement that Konig is not an employee, but is employed by an independent entity contracted to provide medical services. Kaiser said it has suspended his credentials and his ability to treat patients, pending investigation.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
What is ‘classified’ information? What are ‘secure’ communications? Here’s a primer,https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-yemen-houthis-signal-gabbard-ratcliffe-d6f8525a784233552b480676092bcc92,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)     WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration’s use of a popular messaging app to discuss sensitive military plans — with a journalist onthe text chain— israising questionsabout security and the importance of safeguarding the nation’s secrets. It’s also highlighting the differences between classified and public information, and demonstrating that even encrypted apps like Signal can lead to embarrassing leaks if the humans doing the texting don’t follow basic security tips. President Donald Trump’sadministration says no classified material was leakedwhen senior officials used Signal to discuss upcoming attack plans against the Houthi rebels in Yemen — even though a journalist was on the chat. But even if the information had been declassified by the Pentagon, it contained details that would have been highly valuable to the Houthis or other adversaries, showing how sometimes the decision of what to classify is a judgment call. The federal government routinely classifies vast amounts of information pertaining to military and intelligence operations. The material ranges from top secret nuclear programs or the identities of undercover agents all the way to mundane records that would be of little interest to anyone, let alone America’s adversaries. In 2011, for example, the CIA finally declassified itsrecipe for invisible ink— from 1917. Advocates for open government have long complained that the push for secrecy goes too far, by protecting information that could shine a light on government activities or matters of public interest, including aboutUFO sightingsand a60-year-old presidential assassination.  While the public typically calls any information withheld by the government “classified,” that term only refers to the three broad categories used to “classify” information based on the need for secrecy: confidential, secret and top secret. While files marked “confidential” contain information that’s not meant to be released, the need for security or access restrictions isn’t as great as for material considered “top secret,” which includes the nation’s nuclear secrets and other material that, if released, could pose a grave danger to national security. While the Pentagon hasn’t offered classification details about the information in the Signal chats, information about upcoming military strikes is typically tightly guarded to ensure adversaries don’t have advance warning that could jeopardize the mission or put American service members at risk. The Pentagon closely guards even some publicly available information. Material categorized as “controlled unclassified information,” while not secret, is still considered sensitive enough that military service members are prohibited from discussing it on unsecured devices like personal phones. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were asked about that policy during a Senate hearing this week as they were grilled over the Signal chat. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona noted that Department of Defense policy “prohibits discussion of even what is called controlled unclassified information on unsecured devices,” and asked if Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who oversees the nation’s 18 intelligence agencies, were aware of that rule. “I haven’t read that policy,” Gabbard said. “I’m not familiar with the DOD policy,” Ratcliffe said. The power to classify or declassify lies in the hands of top federal officials, including the president and Cabinet secretaries. For military information like the attack plans discussed over Signal, the power lies with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced demands that he resign over the leak. The president’s ability to declassify information has been invoked when presidents have been accused of mishandling secrets. Trump ally Kash Patel, now the FBI director, hassaid he witnessed Trump declassify materialthat was taken after his first term to the president’s Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, but no evidence has emerged to support that claim. The Pentagon hasn’t said whether Hegseth declassified the attack plans before or after the Signal conversation, but Ratcliffe, Gabbard and the White House have all said the chats contained no classified information. “I haven’t participated in any Signal group messaging that relates to any classified information at all,” Ratcliffe proclaimed at one point. That explanation has failed to satisfy Democrats who say that plans for imminent military strikes are regularly classified. National security experts agree. They say it would be highly unusual for the Pentagon to publicize such information and that any lower-level officer caught leaking such material on Signal would face serious repercussions. For many consumers, encrypted apps likeSignalcan offer greater protections for everyday conversations. But that doesn’t mean they’re secure enough for government secrets, or immune to human error, as the inclusion of a reporter on the text chain shows. Senior federal officials who handle classified data receive extensive training about the need to use approved devices and platforms to discuss government secrets. Intelligence and national security agencies have whole departments devoted to cybersecurity and the protection of state secrets. Government cybersecurity officials haverecommendedthat federal employees use encrypted apps like Signal, which can offer greater security for routine communication, and Ratcliffe said this week it was a “permissible” app for senior officials to use. But the app is only as secure as the device it’s downloaded onto. The government’s most sensitive information is typically discussed in a facility known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, which is designed to allow officials to review or discuss secrets without fear of eavesdropping or cyber intrusion. Any senior official using a personal device to discuss classified material could be at risk of cyberespionage, said Michael Williams, an expert on international relations and national security at Syracuse University. “Signal may be encrypted, but it’s the devices that are really the issue,” Williams said. “All of these people are being targeted.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Min Aung Hlaingsaid as he announced on television that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others were injured in his country.

(AP Photo/Wason Wanichakorn)   Myanmar is in an active earthquake belt, though many of the temblors happen in sparsely populated areas, not cities like those affected Friday. The U.S. Geological Survey, an American government science agency, estimated that the death toll could top 1,000.  In Mandalay, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including one of the city’s largest monasteries. Photos from the capital city of Naypyidaw showed rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of multiple buildings used to house civil servants.    Myanmar’s governmentsaid blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept assistance. The United Nations allocated $5 million to start relief efforts. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response, but some experts were concerned about this effort given his administration’s deep cuts in foreign assistance.  But the effects of his administration’s deep cuts in foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department will likely be tested in any response to the first big natural disaster of his second term.  But amid images of buckled and cracked roads and reports of a collapsed bridge and a burst dam, there were concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a humanitarian crisis.  “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,” said Mohammed Riyas, the International Rescue Committee’s Myanmar director.

(AP Photo/Aung Shine Oo)       Myanmar’s English-language state newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said five cities and towns had seen building collapses and two bridges had fallen, including one on a key highway between Mandalay and Yangon. A photo on the newspaper’s website showed wreckage of a sign that read “EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT,” which the caption said was part of the capital’s main 1,000-bed hospital.  Elsewhere, video posted online showed robed monks in a Mandalay street, shooting their own video of the multistory Ma Soe Yane monastery before it suddenly fell into the ground. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed. Video also showed damage to the former royal palace.

(The Myanmar Military True News Information Team via AP)   Christian Aid said its partners and colleagues on the ground reported that a dam burst in the city, causing water levels to rise in the lowland areas.  Residents of Yangon, the nation’s largest city, rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. In Naypyitaw, some homes stood partly crumbled, while rescuers heaved away bricks from the piles of debris. An injured man reclined on a wheeled stretcher, while another man fanned him in the heat.  In a country where many people already were struggling, “this disaster will have left people devastated,” said Julie Mehigan, who oversees Christian Aid’s work in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.  “Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,” Mehigan said.  Myanmar’s military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones.  Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.

(AP Photo/Wason Wanichakorn)       In Thailand, a 33-story building under construction crumpled into a cloud of dust near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market, and onlookers could be seen screaming and running in a video posted on social media. Vehicles on a nearby freeway came to a stop.  Sirens blaredacross the Thai capital’s downtown as a rescuers streamed to the wreckage. Above them, shredded steel and broken concrete blocks, some stacked like pancakes, rose in a towering heap. Injured people were rushed away on gurneys, and hospital beds were also wheeled outside onto a sidewalk.  “It’s a great tragedy,” Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said after viewing the site.  While the area is prone to earthquakes, they rarely are felt in the Bangkok metropolitan area, home to more than 17 million people. Many live in high-rise apartments.  Voranoot Thirawat, a lawyer working in central Bangkok, said she first realized something was wrong when she saw a light swinging back and forth. Then she heard the building creaking, and she and her colleagues fled down 12 flights of stairs. People who evacuated from buildings following earthquake in Bangkok, Thailand, Friday, March 28, 2025. (AP Photo/Chutima Lalit)   “In my lifetime, there was no earthquake like this in Bangkok,” she said.  Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland, was in one of Bangkok’s many malls when the quake struck.  “All of a sudden, the whole building began to move. Immediately, there was screaming and a lot of panic,” he said. Some people fled down upward-moving escalators, he said.  Nearby, Paul Vincent, a tourist visiting from England, recalled seeing a high-rise building swaying, water falling from a rooftop pool and people crying in the streets.  The U.S. Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ center for geosciences said the earthquake was a shallow 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to preliminary reports. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more damage.    To the northeast, the earthquake was felt in China’s Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused damage and injuries in the city of Ruili on the border with Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.  The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet.

South Carolina wildfire keeps growing as firefighters protect homes,https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-south-carolina-north-carolina-b0bcec7ff4dd854f0a3219146db36cb0,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. When Nicole Taylor and her family moved to their new home in the South Carolina mountains six months ago, the gorgeous view of Table Rock Mountain was the clincher. She ended up with a porch-side seat to one of at least a half dozen wildfires in the Blue Ridge Mountains of the Carolinas, fed by dry conditions and millions of trees that were knocked down by Hurricane Helene in 2024 and began decaying into tinderbox fuel. Taylor watched this past weekend as smoke started to rise from the ridges across Highway 11 in Pickens County. The smoke got worse Monday, and it was pouring off the mountain Tuesday when she got a text saying she was under a mandatory evacuation. Helicopters and airplanes are being used in the ongoing fight against wildfires in South Carolina. April is typically the worst month for wildfires across the state.

(AP Photo/Allison Joyce)                       A largewildfirein the South Carolina mountains has doubled in size on each of the last three days. But fire crews have been able to keep the blaze away from structures. Firefighters battling theTable Rock Mountain firehave concentrated on saving lives and property by digging fire breaks that push the blaze north through undeveloped land on the Pickens County ridges near the North Carolina state line, officials said Friday. No injuries have been reported.  Airplanes and helicopters have completed more than 550 water-dropping missions on the Table Rock fire and a second blaze on Persimmon Ridge about 8 miles (13 kilometers) away. But for now it ismostly defensein the Blue Ridge Mountains until the weather cooperates with a soaking rain or lessening winds, South Carolina Forester Scott Phillips said at a news conference Friday at Table Rock State Park. South Carolina officials warn that it’s going to be a long wildfire season. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports. “With these fires and the conditions we are facing in the state right now — the dryness of the fuel, the extremely low humidity, the high winds that we’re having — containment is very, very difficult to achieve,” Phillips said. The Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires have burned about 17 square miles (44 square kilometers). The Table Rock fire started a week ago and has been doubling in size since Tuesday as windy and dry conditions have spread through the mountains. InNorth Carolina, at least eight fires were burning in the mountains. The largest — the Black Cove Fire and the Deep Woods Fire in Polk County — were becoming more contained. They have scorched about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) combined but have barely grown late this week.  And while those fires have received the most attention, the wildfire season has already been busy thanks to a drought andHurricane Helenesix months ago knocking down millions of trees. Thefallen treesact as fuel and block firefighters trying to get to blazes. “It will be a continuing issue for the next several years. It’s going to change the way we have to attack fires in the mountains of South Carolina,” Phillips said. Firefighters helping the state Forestry Commission have fought 373 wildfires in South Carolina that have burned more than 28 square miles (73 squarer kilometers) just in March. “That’s orders of magnitude more than we typically do within a month –- even more than we do in some years as far as the number of acres burned,” Phillips said. April is typically the worst month for wildfires and long-term forecasts don’t show conditions changing much. “This is going to be a long season for us,” Phillips said. A ban an outdoor burning has been in place for more than a week in South Carolina. Officials have given no indication when they will lift it. Gov. Henry McMaster reminded people that violating the burn ban can mean jail time, and starting a fire even through negligence could leave someone on the hook for everything damaged. “You go out and start a fire and you burn your neighbor’s house down –- you owe them a house,” McMaster said. Weather forecasts for the weekend have encouraging news. Calm winds are predicted overnight, and rain should fall Sunday and Monday, although the National Weather Service is not predicting the kind of soaking firefighters want. “We’re going to get it out,” McMaster said of the fires. “We’re hoping we are going to have some rain, have some help. Everybody put that in your prayers.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
"Music Review: Mumford & Sons return after seven years with a folksy, existential album, ‘Rushmere’",https://apnews.com/article/mumford-sons-rushmere-music-review-56b8e1e79b14eeedba2b45065bb88eef,"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This cover image released by Glassnote Records shows “Rushmere” by Mumford & Sons. (Glassnote Records via AP) This cover image released by Glassnote Records shows “Rushmere” by Mumford & Sons. (Glassnote Records via AP)     In the 2010s,Mumford & Sons’stomp-clap rock ruled. The English band had not just ushered in a new wave of bluegrass Americana revivalism, they’d created a movement. Then life happened: the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, banjoist and lead guitaristWinston Marshall left the bandand frontman Marcus Mumford released a solo album. Now a trio, Mumford & Sons are back with their fifth studio album and first in nearly seven years, “Rushmere.” It’s a familiar-feeling record — of course there are banjos — with instantly recognizable folk instrumentation reinforced by swelling vocals. In that way, it detours slightly from their last offering, 2018’s “Delta,” with its electronic interludes. Instead, “Rushmere” directly embraces the band’s folk heritage. To create “Rushmere,” Mumford & Sons enlisted producer Dave Cobb and recorded in Nashville, Tennessee; Savannah, Georgia; and at Mumford’s U.K. studio in Devon. It’s both a return-to-home and an exercise in ambition. Opener “Malibu” begins with muted percussion and acoustic guitar strums, raising the question: Is this going to be a quiet, introspective record? Marcus Mumford’s voice comes in, then piano, then the stacked vocal harmonies, then the banjo. The song’s texture gets richer and richer, and the question answers itself. This is the foot-tapping M&S that originally fueled the band’s popularity, from their 2009 debut “Sigh No More” to the years that followed. “I’m still afraid/I said too much/Or not enough,” Mumford sings. He sets the tone for an album that grapples with weighty issues like truth, hypocrisy and lies all while tapping into the band’s folk roots. Allusions to Christianity crop up in the album, but Mumford doesn’t dwell too much on metaphor. Instead, these songs are refreshingly transparent.  Take “Rushmere,” the second single off the album and its title track. The song is pure nostalgia, named after the London pond where the band hung out in their early days and imagined what their futures would look like. “Don’t you miss/The breathlessness/The wildness in the eye?” Mumford sings, reflecting back with the wisdom that comes with age. “Come home late in the morning light.” But the album is not just a band attempting to reinvent the wheel. Bluesy bass and electric guitar make “Truth” the most rock ‘n’ roll song on the album, and it stands out all the more because it follows the finger-picking ballad “Monochrome.” “Carry On,” the record’s parting song, has perhaps the heaviest lyrics and most overt religious themes, balanced by bright guitars and gentle percussion. Mumford confronts the church doctrine of “original sin” with its potential for hypocrisy. “I will take this darkness/Over any light you cast/You and all your original sin,” he sings. “Carry on/'Cause there’s no evil in a child’s eyes.” Across 10 tracks, “Rushmere” feels short but full, a satisfying contrast and a welcomed return for fans of the band — and anyone open to their folky existentialism.
